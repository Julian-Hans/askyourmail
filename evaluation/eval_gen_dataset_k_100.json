The method by \nwhich this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity \ninterests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of \nSutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which \nare held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with \nENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount \nrepresenting the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making \na floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment \nfrom Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things \nhappen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of \nthe projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) \nraises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, \npurchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In \nother words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its \nreceiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash \nproceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a \nfloating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram \nbelow.\n\nWith this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  \nThe tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from \nWhitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from \nDonette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, \nis Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need \nto occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the \ndefinition of \"Indebtedness\" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP \nAgreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE \nAcquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into \nissues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they \nwill get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of \nwho is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss \nthe mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to \nopen up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to \nrevisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy \ntask.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need \nto determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require \nCertificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A \nfinal logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be \nresponsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.\n\nMore generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with \nrespect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?\n\nIf you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll \nbe in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time \ndiscussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next \nweek.\n\nBest regards,\n\nStuart\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Stuart Schardin/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 \n11:09 ---------------------------\n\n\nAnne Edgley\n24/02/2000 09:48\nTo: Stuart Schardin/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Re: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Anne Edgley/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 09:49 \n---------------------------\nFrom: Cynthia Harkness on 23/02/2000 12:28 CST\nTo: Mark Evans/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Donette Dewar/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne Edgley/LON/ECT@ECT, Maroun J \nAbboudy/LON/ECT@ECT, Stephen Dwyer/LON/ECT@ECT, AnnMarie \nTiller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James Ginty/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ben F \nGlisan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment  \n\nDear All,\n\nI will be leaving Enron Global Finance this Friday to join Enron Broadband \nServices, Inc.

So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron \nAustralia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power \nderivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid \nout by the Government. These require \" that before entering into a contract \nwith a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia \nFinance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds:\n(a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and\n(b) that the counterparty is contracting on its own account.\" \n\nThis obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the \ncounterparty has an Australian presence or not.\n \nIn the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide \ncounterparties with an Enron Corp. guaranty. (Although this strict legal \nobligation\nprovision was deleted in July 1999.)\n\n Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist  was a \nprocedure to vet potential counterparties. We have procedures in place in the \nSydney office to do this. I understood  that this activity would still be \ndone in Sydney ie our list of 26 counterparties. the alternative was to \ndevelop procedures if it was to done else where.   \n\nOn Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the \nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a \nscreen based trading system. (This is a legal requirement). Although unlikely \nthey may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties.\nI was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures. \n\nIn short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to \ncounterparties that do not have an Australian presence. The major sensitivity \nis taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being \ndirected outside Australia. On reviewing the subject this evening  I agree \nwith Chris Catts there does\nnot appear to be an issue. But I endorse Heidi's comment that now we know \nthat there could be non-resident counterparties (a first for us) lets close \noff the tax \nissue. I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT  \nResources International Corp. GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an \nappropriate clause. \n\n\n\n\nHeidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris. We \ncould hopefully settle the words.  \n\nIn the interim  I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory. David F if you must \nload GTCs Friday (Houston time) then I suggest we go with what we have. I \nwould ask for one small change.One small change though. Tana picked up one \npoint.  A new paragraph 2.1 (f) should be included as follows. \n\n\"(f)  Subparagragh 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all \nTransactions\"\n\n             \n\n \n    \n\n\n\n\nHeidi Mason\n03/17/2000 04:54 PM\nTo: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul \nSmith/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Arfan \nAziz/LON/ECT@ECT, Susan Musch/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Re: Australian Status  \n\nDave\n\nI have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier:\n\nI spoke with David Minns re the 'Eligible Persons' criteria, and he noted \nthat while he had discussed the capital/asset holding criteria with Tana, he \nhad not provided to anyone the other criteria, and that while these may be \ncovered by the US criteria, there will need to be a review of all criteria \nbefore we can assess that all are covered. \nI spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that \nprovided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made, \nthere will be no with-holding tax issues re the payments/receipts. I am going \nto meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to \nreview the GTC.\n\nOn the settlement issue, in the short term the best way to do the settlements \nfor non-NEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston (this is how we \nsettled our one previous cross border transaction) as this gives a third \nparty review of the payments prior to release.\n\nRegards\n\nHeidi\n\n\n\nDavid Forster@ECT\n17/03/2000 11:10\nTo: Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Heidi \nMason/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul \nSmith/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Arfan Aziz/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Australian Status\n\nAs I understand it, the current situation with regard to international \ncompanies being able to transact on Australian power is this:\n\nThe only remaining potential issue is witholding tax. This may or may not be \nan issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason. If it is an issue, it is \npossible that we can borrow some language from the U.S. financial GTC. Heidi \nwill coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution (if required) for \nincorporation into the Australian GTC.\n\nAn issue was raised with regard to \"Eligible Persons\", and the requirement \nthat an \"Eligible Person\" hold more than $AUS 10 million. However, Tana Jones \nhas been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the \nU.S. requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones, hence \nthe application of U.S. criteria for Financial trades should be more than \nsufficient to meet the Australian \"Eligible Persons\" requirements. \nFurthermore, a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies \nwith an E-rating of less than 4 have been approved by credit.\n\nAn issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of \nAustra-Clear. However, as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign \ncompanies transacting on Australian power in the near term, this should be a \nproblem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not \nimpact the GTC, the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles.\n\nAt this point, I am anticipating (possibly) having a witholding tax revision \nto the GTC, which will be uploaded to the system on Friday (Houston time).\n\nIf anyone has any questions or concerns, please contact me on 713 853 1861 \n(office) or 713 562 8678 (cell).\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n"

While not all of the changes will\n   be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on everyday\n   activities.

Security resides in our business\n   controls  organization.  You can contact this organization through their\n   website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or\n   by                   email                  (CorporateSecurity@enron.com\n   <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   John  Brindle, Senior Director,\n   Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide\n   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions, or to report\n   security threats.\n\n   We  have  two  areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures\n   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our travel\n   advisory.\n\n   Access to the Enron Center\n\n   Over  the next few days, the following access control procedures will be\n   instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):\n\n        ?  As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the\n           Enron  Center,  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the\n           bearer.\n\n        ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a\n           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center (U.S.\n           driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S.\n           federal, state or local identification).\n\n        ?   Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when\n           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill\n           out  the  visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID\n           (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form\n           of  U.S.  federal,  state  or  local identification) will not be\n           allowed access to the Enron Center.\n\n        ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an Enron\n           employee or badged contractor at all times.\n\n        ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by an\n           Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log\n           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or  badged\n           contractor,   and   escorted   to  their  appointment.   At  the\n           conclusion  of  the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to\n           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge\n           collected,  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the plaza\n           reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.\n\n        ?  Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of\n           their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious\n           activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors\n           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open, allowing\n           \"tail gating\" by others.\n\n   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to be\n   instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient during\n   congested  times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard\n   personnel  and  equipment,  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We\n   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security\n   of all our employees.\n\n\n   Travel Advisory Update\n\n   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we  have  two important\n   recommendations:\n\n        ?   While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security\n           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.\n           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during this\n           time  to  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,\n           Sudan,  Somalia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Georgia,  and  the\n           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In addition, we recommend that\n           planned   travel  to  Egypt,  Israel,  Gaza/West  Bank,  Jordan,\n           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very carefully\n           considered.\n\n        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate\n           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There have\n           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in\n           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation\n           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we suggest\n           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the United\n           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -\n           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We\n           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their\n           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status as a\n           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration Officials\n           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry his/her\n           \"registration\"  documentation  with  them at all times. This can\n           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment\n           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary\n           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been\n           asking  domestic travelers for \"registration\" documentation, but\n           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current\n           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your\n           documentation proving your current lawful status.\n\n   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the\n   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.\n\n\n"

            "body": "\nToday, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.

As far as I know, we have never had a \nproduct that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us \nhere?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the \nsecond issue (deals shorter than one month):\n\nEach calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a \nDetermination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less \nthan one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the \nTransaction.\n\nIn some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the \npayment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month \n(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a \ncommercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.\n\nIf mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up \nwith alternative language.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\tHomer Lin\n\t06/01/2001 10:15 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe King/Enron@EnronXGate, Scott \nMoncrieff/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t cc: Carlos Alatorre/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert Quick/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t Subject: Re: Tanker Freight Long Description\n\nMark,\n\nLooks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping \nproducts that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.\n\nI'm a little concerned about the line: \"Each calendar month during the term \nof the Transaction will be a Determination Period\"...\n\nIs it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to \nmid-month?\nAs in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another \nLong Description that we would have to draft for another product type?\n\nAlso, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller \nincrements than one month?  \nLet us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.\n\nMay be something like:\n\"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a \nDetermination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates\"\n\nThat's my two cents,\nHomer\nx57642\n\n\n\nFrom: Mark Taylor on 05/31/2001 06:25 PM\nTo: Joe King/Enron@EnronXGate, Homer Lin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carlos \nAlatorre/Enron@EnronXGate\ncc: Scott Moncrieff/Enron@EUEnronXGate, Robert Quick/Enron@EUEnronXGate \nSubject: Tanker Freight Long Description\n\nHere is a draft of the US version.

We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it.  Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562].  Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].\n\nIf yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGermany, Chris  \nSent:\tMonday, March 25, 2002 10:06 AM\nTo:\tHamic, Priscilla; Dhont, Margaret\nCc:\tPolsky, Phil; Boyt, Eric; Sanchez, Christina; McMichael Jr., Ed; Parks, Joe; Dinari, Sabra L.; Germany, Chris\nSubject:\tFW: Dominion prepay for City of Tallahassee deal for March 2002\n\nPer David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.

My comments/questions were:\n\nWhat is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as \nagent for the client?  What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the \ntrade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable?  The margin will secure the \nrisk between treansaction and confirmation with the counterparty.  the broker \nwill pay liquidated damages if counterparty does not accept the trade.  (risk \nis essentially 1-3 days)\n\nI assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker, \ncovering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to \nbind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of \nagent/liability of agent/margin arrangements)  Yes.  Mark Taylor is drafting \nthe agreement.  the agreement will lay out the margin requirements, \nliquidated damages, etc.  I am not sure that the broker is acting as a agent \nfor the customer as the customer may not even know that the broker is \ntransacting on EnronOnline.\n\nI assume that the client will be an approved EOL counterparty with trading \naccess for the particular product Not neccesarily.  the customer must however \nhave a profile set up in enronOnline and must have a credit headroom in \nEnronOnline.  We can potentially paper the transaction under normal OTC \nprocess.\n\nWe will need to ensure that the client agrees to be bound by each trade \nconcluded through the agent, notwithstanding the intermediation of the agent \n(it would seem to me that we should create special ETAs/PAs for this purpose \n- e.g. each trade is effected by the \"click\" of the agent, not the client; \nthe ETA does not contemplate intermediation; the PA relates to the use of \npasswords by a principal and not its agent)  Mark is also drafting a BTA \n(broker transaction agreement.  Once again the broker is not acting as agent \nrather they will release the rights and obligations under the transaction to \nthe counterparty.\n\nThe agent will, in its terms of business with the client, need to ensure that \nit is authorised to bind the client with respect all trades, whether effected \nonline (including EOL) or offline  This is not the case today in OTC \ntransactions and will not neccessarily be the case with the EnronOnline \nbroker client.\n\nThe agent will need to meet the usual legal/regulatory/financial tests, as if \nit were acting as principal - e.g. in the case of derivatives trades, the \nagent must be regulated to carry on its business by the UK SFA [no doubt, the \nCFTC swaps exemption test will also need to be met]  Lets discuss\n\nThe agent must also be a corporate or similar commercial enterprise The \nbroker must be financially able to meet margin requirements\n\nLook forward to your response.\n\nThanks\n\nJustin\n\n\n\n\nTo: Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron, Michael \nBridges/NA/Enron@ENRON, Teresa Smith/Corp/Enron@Enron \n\nSubject: Broker Client Process flow\n\nWe are currently in discussions with 3-4 brokers (including GFI in London) to \nallow them to transact on behalf of their customers via EnronOnline.
