Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.\n\nKam,\n\nWe talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.\n\nThanks,\nScott Dozier\nClient Services - Settlements\nEnron Net Works LLC\noffice: 713.345.7213\nfax: 713.646.8420\nemail: scott.dozier@enron.com\n\n << File: CoralEne05Def.xls >> \n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDozier, Scott  \nSent:\tWednesday, December 19, 2001 10:01 AM\nTo:\tChristiansen, Suzanne\nCc:\tJacobs, Charles; Valderrama, Lisa\nSubject:\tCoral - 5/01 Deficiency Charges\n\nSuzanne,\n\nHere is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.

Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).\n\nI have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.\n\nA counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  \n\nIt may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.

But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.

Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  \n\nAnother item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.

Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. "

Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.\n\n\nPower Month End Calculation Procedures\n\n\n?\tAt each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.\n?\tPower curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).\n?\tRisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.\n\nThis procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  \n\nBelow is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.\n\tChoose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.\n\n\tChoose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.\n\nChoose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).\n\nIn addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.\n\n << OLE Object: Paintbrush Picture >> "

John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  \n\nENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.\n\nI don't know the outcome of their conversation.\n\nI thought your group might be able to help him.

As far as I know, we have never had a \nproduct that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us \nhere?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the \nsecond issue (deals shorter than one month):\n\nEach calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a \nDetermination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less \nthan one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the \nTransaction.\n\nIn some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the \npayment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month \n(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a \ncommercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.\n\nIf mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up \nwith alternative language.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\tHomer Lin\n\t06/01/2001 10:15 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe King/Enron@EnronXGate, Scott \nMoncrieff/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t cc: Carlos Alatorre/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert Quick/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t Subject: Re: Tanker Freight Long Description\n\nMark,\n\nLooks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping \nproducts that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.\n\nI'm a little concerned about the line: \"Each calendar month during the term \nof the Transaction will be a Determination Period\"...\n\nIs it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to \nmid-month?\nAs in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another \nLong Description that we would have to draft for another product type?\n\nAlso, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller \nincrements than one month?  \nLet us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.\n\nMay be something like:\n\"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a \nDetermination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates\"\n\nThat's my two cents,\nHomer\nx57642\n\n\n\nFrom: Mark Taylor on 05/31/2001 06:25 PM\nTo: Joe King/Enron@EnronXGate, Homer Lin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carlos \nAlatorre/Enron@EnronXGate\ncc: Scott Moncrieff/Enron@EUEnronXGate, Robert Quick/Enron@EUEnronXGate \nSubject: Tanker Freight Long Description\n\nHere is a draft of the US version.

Those changes \nare redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 \nas well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to \nexhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they \ntypically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it \nanyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined \ncycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, \nthen they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and \ntheir defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust \nguarantees.  Let me know what they decide.\n\nExhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to \nyour file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I \ntherefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a \nseparate word file. \n\nExhibit F is \"boiler plate\" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit \"U\" is not in my \nhard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit \"T.\"   If you get something from \nGE on Exhibit \"U\", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  \n\nIf you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn \nWednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.\n\nThanks,\nEric Booth\n\n\n\n\n"

However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.\n\nEnron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: \n\n1. Continuing to trade\n\nThe directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. \n\nThe directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  \n\nI would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. \n\n\n2. Filing accounts\n\nThe directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. \n\nI should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? \n\nWe now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? \n\n\nThat's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. \n\nMany thanks.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark\n\n\n\n "

We requested the meeting with you yesterday to explain what we wer=\ne doing and why we needed the other three EES LSE accounts.  We also took t=\nhe time to explain the process for establishing new LSE accounts, under a L=\nLC structure which is not complicated, but the structure that the new LSE a=\nccounts would be created under (SPV) is inconsistent with the masters negot=\niated and EES would not be able to perform under these masters.\n\nWe have tried to work with you in cooperation to accomplish your goals cons=\nistent with the constraints of the ERCOT rules.  We have explained our need=\ns and the reason for them. We conveyed our interest in working together to =\naccomplish the greater good for the company and offered our help in any way=\n we could.  You mark and I agreed that it would be easier to help each othe=\nr and not duplicate efforts.  We were appreciative of your willingness to p=\nroceed consistent with this spirit of cooperation.  It disheartens and surp=\nrises me that you would leave the meeting with this understanding and in ag=\nreement of the business situation and send an e-mail the next morning, with=\nout picking up the phone or stopping by to discuss this and just attempt to=\n dictatorially commandeer the LSE accounts that you knew were committed and=\n why they were committed. =20\n\nMoreover; you told us that you thought you might need one more and you have=\n attempted to take three more.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n\nFrom:=09Joseph Wagner/ENRON@enronXgate on 10/16/2001 09:14 AM\nTo:=09Mark Bernstein/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Ader/HOU/EES@EES\ncc:=09Nancy Hetrick/ENRON@enronXgate, Rogers Herndon/ENRON@enronXgate, Pres=\nton Ochsner/ENRON@enronXgate=20\nSubject:=09ERCOT LSE's\n\nThank you for taking the time to discuss the LSE situation in ERCOT.

National's Emerald Club \nmembership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the \ntransaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid \nreturn.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron \ntravelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron \nAmerican Express T&E Cardholders.

We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the \nshares in a Cayman entity.\n\nI propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those \ncertificates to Enron South America LLC, the sole shareholder of EBPH XII.  \nThe value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US \ntax treatment.   Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock, using \nthe screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good \nindicator of the fair market value.  For tax purposes, we will assume the \nvalue to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a \nnarrow band on either side of that value.    If the first 1.25M certificate \nis sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC, we will need \nto adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a \nvalid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the \ndistribution..\n\nIf the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis, EBPHXII will \nrecognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the \ndistribution was made to Enron South America LLC. This would result in \nreporting a tax expense in 2000 and perhaps book income in 2001 if that sale \ntakes place after the end of the year.   \n\nIf the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less \nthan the historical tax basis, the distribution to Enron South America LLC \nwill result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII.\n\nIf the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies, the same \nvaluation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on \nthe sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated.  Distributing the shares to Enron \nSouth America LLC will be much easier.\n\nLynn\n\n\n\nBruce Harris\n12/08/2000 11:31 AM\nTo: Robert H George/NA/Enron@Enron, Kay Young/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Dan Boyle/Corp/Enron@Enron, Lynn Aven/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe \nKishkill/SA/Enron@Enron, Kent Castleman/NA/Enron@Enron, Bruce \nHarris/NA/Enron@Enron, Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edward E \nGraham/SA/Enron@Enron, Rick Hopkinson/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey E \nSommers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Next steps with Copel shares\n\n\nRobert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of \nBrazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next \nweek the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron \nvault.  \n\nHere is what we now need to do:\n\n1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it \ninto three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately \n1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.\n\n2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital \nsplit?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.\n\n3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision \n(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel \nshares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will \ngo to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would \nhappen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about \n15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).\n\n4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need \nto put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we \nwill bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).\n\n5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to \nestablish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate \nto unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to \nfigure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for \nevery small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these \n1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets \n(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 \nmonths time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  \n\nRobert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer \nshares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M \"unrestriction\" with BONY and Skadden. \n\n\nRegards,  Bruce\n713-853-0950 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our\ncounsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.\n\n2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section\n(b),\nI\nbelieve that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5\n(b)(g)(ii)\nis to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep\nbelow it.\n\n3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different\nfrom\nthe setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has\nfulfilled\nall\nof its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to\nit\n(the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that\nit\nowes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of\nsetoff\nrights.\n\n4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the\nremoval\nof the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration\napply.\n\n5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US\nDollars.\n\n6.

Following are comments and questions regarding\ncertain negotiated points:\n\nEOT Claim Agreement\n\nOwner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;\nif not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's \ncommissioning\nobligations\n\nWe observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner\nto correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is\nintroduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the\nowner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.\n\nRisk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas\n\nWe understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the\nOwner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance \ncoverage\nintended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).\nPlease confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance \ncoverage\nif a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor\naction during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have\nthis point reviewed by an insurance advisor.\n\nDegradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during\ncommissioning\n\nDuring our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to\ntest to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of\ncurves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.\nWe observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the\nbenefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently\nreview the basis for the curves.\n\nPerformance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by\nowner\n\nPlease explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.\n\nDelay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas\n\nDuring our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand\ndown until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil\nfiring performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is\nnot complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.\nPlease confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated\npoint.\n\nTAA Agreement\n\nNo 12-month look back.\n\nWe assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored \ninto\nthe availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an\nextension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result \nof\ndropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated\npoint affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how \navailability\nwill be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are\nconcerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if\nmaintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not\nbeing dispatched.\n\n12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas\ncommissioning unless owner delay.\n\nWe interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for \nthe\ninitial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it\ntakes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to\nOwner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the \nperformance\ntesting on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.\n\nIn order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if\nthere are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated\nthat we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business\ninterruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve\nthe issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,\ndesign, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.\nIncidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which\nis not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18\nmonths per event with US$150,000 deductible.\n\nStone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review \nthis\npoint.\n\nThanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.\n\nRegards,\n\nBradley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amo=\nunt of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor =\nis at the minimum rating (listed as \"BBB\" from S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" from =\nMoody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, F=\nitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guara=\nntor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii)=\n the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York=\n utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely =\npayments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit ra=\nting is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement wi=\nll be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2. =20\n\n=09In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security=\n requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutual=\nly agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash depos=\nit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved=\n by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond =\nissued by a financial institution with at least an \"A\" bond rating; (iii) a=\n security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a g=\nuarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit r=\nating of at least \"BBB\" by S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" by Moody's; (v) payments =\nmade by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which wi=\nll reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be requi=\nred); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adeq=\nuate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your informatio=\nn, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) a=\nfter providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails t=\no pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within =\nthe 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy=\n (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier=\n) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its custom=\ners under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. =\n186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).\n\n=09Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional info=\nrmation.\n\n=09MLC\n\n"

When the cake says \"Happy  Birthday Mijo\" instead of the child's real name.\n3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.\n4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.\n5.    It's \"Mijo's\" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.\n6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.\n7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.\n8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.\n9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.\n10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.\n11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.\n12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say \"Mira, tan cute!\"\n13.    Someone else says  \"I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.\n14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, \"I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.\"\n15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.\n16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.\n17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.\n18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.\n19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.\n20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.\n21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.\n22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.\n23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.\n24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.\n25.    It's \"Mijo's\" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.\n \nPower to la Raza\n \nI thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........\n\n \n\n\n"

Thanks.\n\n\n\nDJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n\n\n(This article was originally published Thursday)\n\n\n     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission \nlikely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall \nprofits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and \ncustomers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.\n\n     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating \nthe wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the \n\"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done.\"\n\n     \"Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court \nto decide if generators should refund money,\" the commissioner said. \"I don't \nthink the state is willing to spend the money or the time.\"\n\n     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison \nInternational (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit \nPacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their \nratepayers, the commissioner said.\n\n     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.\n\n     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support \nhaving generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The \ncommission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's \ntroubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence \nthat would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to \ndocuments obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate \nthe market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said \nrates were \"unjust and unreasonable.\"\n\n     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also \nconcluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in \norder to drive up wholesale power prices.\n\n     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to \npass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.\n\n     The commissioner said \"if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the \nutilities would be left holding the bag.\"\n\n     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale \npower. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a \nstate-mandated rate freeze.\n\n     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive \nOfficer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover \nmore than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay \noff employees and reduce major capital spending.\n\n     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow \nthe utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.\n\n     -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; \nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-11-00\n\n\n\n\n"

This \nnew unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment \nunits of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron \nSpecial Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  \nThe strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the \nbusiness units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, \nwhich leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments \nmay be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and \ndistressed debt positions.   \n\nKevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of \nEnron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, \nand their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal \nInvestments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, \nconsisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. \n\n Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick \nand the other members of this group in this effort.\n\nJeff Skilling\n"

Thanks.\n\n\n\nDJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n\n\n(This article was originally published Thursday)\n\n\n     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission \nlikely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall \nprofits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and \ncustomers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.\n\n     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating \nthe wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the \n\"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done.\"\n\n     \"Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court \nto decide if generators should refund money,\" the commissioner said. \"I don't \nthink the state is willing to spend the money or the time.\"\n\n     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison \nInternational (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit \nPacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their \nratepayers, the commissioner said.\n\n     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.\n\n     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support \nhaving generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The \ncommission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's \ntroubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence \nthat would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to \ndocuments obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate \nthe market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said \nrates were \"unjust and unreasonable.\"\n\n     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also \nconcluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in \norder to drive up wholesale power prices.\n\n     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to \npass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.\n\n     The commissioner said \"if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the \nutilities would be left holding the bag.\"\n\n     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale \npower. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a \nstate-mandated rate freeze.\n\n     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive \nOfficer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover \nmore than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay \noff employees and reduce major capital spending.\n\n     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow \nthe utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.\n\n     -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; \nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-11-00\n\n\n\n"

I had previ=\nously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.\n\nI was able to run the build route report with the criteria of \"Starting On-=\n June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated.\" A =\ncheck of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all d=\neals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed =\ndates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ=\nction. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn=\nation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped,=\n and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous=\nly extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou=\nld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (We=\nst Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)\n\nNavigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately exec=\nute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will=\n contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the=\n PSW to acheive the same result.\n\nRouting deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with =\na clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total=\n unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi=\noning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar=\n showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longe=\nr than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error li=\nst gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful to=\nol.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I=\n had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors =\nin Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept s=\ntarting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server=\n 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encou=\nraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they we=\nre routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us=\ner error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with w=\nhat I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more c=\nomplicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on p=\neak non shaped deals only.\n\n\n\nThings I did not expect that I liked:\n\nWhen I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when=\n I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells=\n.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler=\n's sheet.\n\n\n\nWhat does not appear to be working at this time:\n\nThe physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr=\noperly in routing.\n\nPath Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one s=\nheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati=\non. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, =\nmany rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I canno=\nt find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path =\nconfirmation.\nWhen the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze=\n.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was =\ndone, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined furthe=\nr.\n\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nThe build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production=\n, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity=\n issues.\n\nPath Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowi=\nng up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran thr=\nough its import function.\n\n\nPlease let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are=\n ready for further testing.\n\nThanks\n\nCara\n503/464-3814\n"

This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment in \nunits located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would go \nout in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970's there was a hue and \ncry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured by \nothers, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however they \nnever considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnection \nwere so large that the \"cost\" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of \nregional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.\n\n If such a foolish thing were done and California full \"closed its doors\" by \nopening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and all \nthe rest of the Western System.  There are \"gains for trade\" which accrue to \nall parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than just \nsummer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resource \ndiversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity to \ncapitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address the \nlast point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.\n\n The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has large \namount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, the \nenergy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.  \nThe reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which \ncan be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can be \nseen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on \nthe Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99, \nJun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen, \nespecially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the \nday and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange \nbenefits lowers costs for everyone.\n\n On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load \ndiversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy \nproduction is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the \nPacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.  \nThe hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.  \nThere is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to \ntotal water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and \nBridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual \nenergy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the \nseasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro \nsystem, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing \nnumber of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help \nto meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until \nthe snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the \nNorthwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from \nDesert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties \nto the Northwest.  \n\n Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a \nmaximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid \nfor the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.  \nMuch system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned \nto take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest \nbenefit from this trade.  \n\n In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and \neveryone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is \ntypically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports \nfrom the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the \nSouth lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo \nsolution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide \nwho would be worst off if California \"closed its doors\".  It is only clear \nthat total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from \nwhich it divorced itself.\n\n I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n\n\tJeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\tSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\t02/28/2001 11:35 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Richard \nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nTo Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often \noperated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's \nsomething in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems \nto always be tied to this notion that \"California is a net importer, even in \nthe winter.\"  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks \ndescribe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.\n\nJust about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:  \nIf California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher \nprices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm \nstruggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable \nto Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place \nand that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has \ndeveloped over the years.\n\nTo keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the \nanalysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.\n\nThe basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the \nsummer.\n\nLet's take two scenarios:\n\n1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its \npeak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so \noverbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.\n\nIrrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA \nto the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.\nThe only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in \nelectricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes \neconomic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must \nbe cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than \nproduce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy \nfrom California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at \na minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California \ncloses its doors.\n\n2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking \nload.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking \nsummer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking \nperiod.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California \ncloses its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.\n\nI realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other \nlegitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW \n(e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not \nhave traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be \nuseful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the \nquestion that Jim asks.\n\nWith that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model \nset forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW \nis long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of \npower?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\tJames D Steffes\n\t02/28/2001 08:05 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nIt seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of \nan open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000 \nMW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, if \nCalifornia were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build \nadditional power plants in-state.\n\nThe cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10 \n500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the \ncurrent fleet of merchant generation).\n\nFrom the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains \n- if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other than \nlegal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government \nwant to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that we \nneed to answer.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes@ECT\n\t02/27/2001 09:40 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary \nHain/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Cost of Protectionism\n\nJim, Jeff:\n\nJim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving \nfrom the current (evolving) system of open access to a \"protectionist\" \nenvironment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body \nresponding to populist pressures.\n\nHere are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or \nSteve Walton's input:\n\nCalifornia is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state \nbeing able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CA \ntrade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.\n\nLimiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.\n this will kill incentives for new investment\n\nIf the ISO's proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a \nprotectionist ISO would go:\n in-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market \nbased rate certificates\n load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a \nreserve margin.  \n  This is costly: it will lead to centralized planning solutions to \nreliability rather than more efficient market     outcomes\n Artifical notions of \"just and reasonable\" rates (on top of unreasonable \nreserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In other \nwords, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will drop \noff     signficanly)\n\nThere is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid \n(e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the current \nsystem has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission \nexpansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  \n\nTXU Energy Trading \nBP Energy Company\nReliant Energy Services, Inc.\nAquila Power Corporation\nMorgan Stanley capitral Group\nConstellation Power Source\nFPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.\nAmerican Electic Power Service Corporation\nMirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP\nCalpine Energy Servicces LP\nDynegy Marketing & Trade\nLCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority\n\nalong with a couple of incumbent utilities:\n\nSan Antonio City Public Service\nReliant HL&P\n\nIf you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 30, 2002 8:41 AM\nTo:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Day, Smith L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Portz, David\nCc:\tWill, Lloyd; Presto, Kevin M.; Bailey, Debra; Haedicke, Mark E.\nSubject:\tUBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs\n\nUBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.

In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of\ninteresting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues\nthat would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I\nleft academics largely because I wanted to move into a more \"front line\"\ncareer. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I\nultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my\nbeing too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly,\nyou are concerned about hands on technical work.

It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals \nhave already\nbeen approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or \ntwo.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\nVince J Kaminski\n15/05/2000 17:14\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick \nBuy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  \n\nJohn,\n\nThis is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.\n\n1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH \nand give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the \ndecision\nto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island \nproject (please, see point 2).\n\n2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest \n(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island \ntransaction. The next step\nwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  \nin one place and\nto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is \nmeeting to close a few\nremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.\n\nA few comments on the book design and my view of the project:\n\na. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island \nfacility\nby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent\nsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term\ncontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.\n\nThe fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the \nlong-term\ncontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are \nsetting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal \ncargos\nbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and \ncoordinating\nthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,\nwe have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.\n\nb. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension \noption of\n5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we\nhave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for \nsuch a long tenor. This is  \nessentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread \nand\nI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.\n\nOne solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the \nfirst\n5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.\n\nc. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions\nregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a \nbig prudence reserve\nin case we mark it to market.\n\nd. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island \ndeal\n(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.\nLong-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail \nthat \ncorrelates very well with Brent.\n\n\nVince\n\n\n\nJohn Sherriff\n05/14/2000 01:40 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: LNG May 19 decision\n\n\nVince\n\nI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  \nAnyway with Greg moving to his\nnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the \nEastern Hemishere plus LNG.\n\nI understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for \nLNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand\nthat another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far \naway).  Anway I understand this\nis a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you \nplease let me know where you stand now?\n\nI will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in \nthe next couple of days and if you\nhave anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.\n\nLook forward to connecting with you Vince.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n"

I believe the only other confirm requiring Enron \nCanada's execution in this transaction is the back-to-back rate swap between \nEnron Canada and ENA, whereby Enron Canada swaps the floating rate for the \nfixed rate with ENA.  You can send that confirm directly to my attention by \ne-mail and I will get it signed and sent back to you.  I understand that you \nwill be attending to obtaining counterparty execution of these confirms.  \nCould you do me a favor and, when you receive the fully executed confirms \nback from the respective counterparties, fax fully executed copies of all the \nconfirms to my attention at 403-974-6707.  I am aggregating copies of all the \ndocuments relating to this financing for our files and will need the executed \nconfirms as part of that process.\n\nThanks\n\nGreg Johnston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her name is Gillian Wright, and \nshe is a \"regulatory case manager\" whatever that is.  She was pleased to hear \nabout the extension til Wed 12:00 for her responses.  The best news is that \nshe was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts on the \nquestions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confirm that \nthe recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to be and it \nis always \"offered.\"  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a little \ndifferent and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the daily \nmarkets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to index \ndeals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumstances.  \nShe took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactly \nthat--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that \nindex deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to \nquestions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she \nthought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she \nviewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra \nmay have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have you \nseen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC \nquestions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.\n\nGillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as \nsoon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.  \nShe said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push for a \ndraft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.   \n\nAs for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow \nmorning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott was \nappreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned to \nmeet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all that \nmuch about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF    \n"

Lee said that \nsenior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week \nbetween the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock \nfutures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  \n\nAs you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it \nrecessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where \ndifferences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions \n(Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee \npassed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving \nquickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant \nchanges made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy \nlanguage). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about \nthe bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed \nfor his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she \nwould rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  \nWhat this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's \nopposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain \nhis support of the legislation.\n\nLee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to \nmove the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all \nnon-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a \ndifficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  \"we \nwould not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language\" \n(which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a \npositive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and \nI hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect \nTreasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that \nCongressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this \nyear and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.\n\nHowever, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm \nto engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could \nbe an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm \nneeds to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your \nthoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call \nand drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.\n    \n\n\n\n\n"

I am confused about Praxair though.\n\nThe sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  \nThe only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial \nAgreement.\n\nDoes Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it \nreally needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to \nHPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.\n\nPlease advise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaren J Farmer\n05/11/2000 03:11 PM\nTo: Cheryl Dudley/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: ENA Sales on HPL  \n\nCheryl, \n\nThe counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:\n\nCity of Brazoria\nCentral Illinois Light Company\nD & H Gas Company, Inc.\nMarkham Gas \nMerit Energy Partners\nPraxair\nReliant Energy - Entex\nReliant Energy - HL&P\nSouthern Union Company\nTexas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)\nUnion Carbide Corporation\nUnit Gas Transmission Company Inc\n\n\nENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most \nlikely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)\n\nAll ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be \ngenerated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.

Gulf Gas Utilities Company\nBrazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.\nCentral Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.\nCentral Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex\nCES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P\nCentral Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company\nD & H Gas Company, Inc.

TXU Gas Distribution\nEntex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation\nEquistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.\n\n\nSince I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes \nsuggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing \nsomething (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him \nand/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the \nabove contracts.\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Cheryl Dudley/HOU/ECT on 05/10/2000 07:56 \nAM ---------------------------\n\n\n\tCheryl D King\n\t05/08/2000 04:11 PM\n\t\nSent by: Cheryl Dudley\nTo: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary M Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: ENA Sales on HPL\n\nI am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you \ncould tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for \nwhich she is looking.\n\nShe is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & \nHPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to \naccomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is \ndoing off of HPL's pipe.\n\nI had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity \non HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will \nthis give me everything that I need?\n\nAre there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in \nSitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas \non it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  \n?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?\n\nIs there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some \nof these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any \nideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.\n\nJenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.\n\nAs there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.\n\nAs no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.\n\nThanks\n\nLouise\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKitchen, Louise  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 17, 2001 12:40 PM\nTo:\tWasaff, George; Pickering, Mark\nCc:\tBlack, Don\nSubject:\tibuyit or IT\n\nHere's a little issue.\n\nWe have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?\n\nThanks\n\nLouise"

The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.\n\nThe main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?\n\nPaul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.\n\nThe third special provision, can go either way, your call?\n\nThe fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?\n\nNormally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.\n\nAlso, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.\n\nLet me know later.\n\nChristy\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Barbe, Robin \nSent: Friday, June 14, 2002 1:43 PM\nTo: Finelli, Christina\nSubject: FW: GISB Base Contract - Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.\n\n\nhere's the gisb.  thanks for your help.\n\nrobin\n37177\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Carol_Wilson@oxy.com [mailto:Carol_Wilson@oxy.com]\nSent: Thursday, June 13, 2002 3:24 PM\nTo: Barbe, Robin\nSubject: GISB Base Contract - Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.\n\n\nRobin,\n\nHow are you doing?

As background, I have been at EECC since\nOctober last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and\njoint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing\nagreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic\ninvestment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston\noffice of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)\nwhere I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex\non their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements\nand CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and\nIPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in\nWashington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions\nsuch as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,\npartnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your\nconsideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from\nvacation (my extension is 6-6127).\n\n(See attached file: EECC Resume.doc)\n\n - EECC Resume.doc\n"

Perhaps the best place to start might be \nwith the business person who has overall responsibility for the relationship \nin question and should have a view on the nature of the relationship and \nwhether we have any info about the entity which is sensitive.  It may well be \nthat we have confidentiality agreements in place, but not much confidential \ninfo passing under them.\n\nGrateful for any views on this.\n\nPaul\n\n\nTo: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul \nSimons/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: Consent  \n\nApparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after \nour meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference \nEntities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were \ngoing to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was \nto dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities \ncould be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each \nproposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or \nnot a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing \nbusiness relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of \nthese evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been \nreasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by \nno means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet \ndetermined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business \nrelationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require \nsignificant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to \nmake important judgment calls.\n\nMy impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice \nletters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved \nyour earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on \nthe assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we \nshould not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those \ncustomers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them \nas a Reference Entity.\n\nWe will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the \nevaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference \nEntities as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nBryan Seyfried\n01/19/2000 06:35 AM\nTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consent\n\nJust to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference \ncredit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at \nthe initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions \nand why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference \ncredits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial \ndecision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  \n\nAs an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits \nhave confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we \nhave a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be \nblack and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that \nare really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small \ncounterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.\n\nHopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies \nfor the miscommunication.\n\nCall me if you want to discuss further.\n\nbs\n\n\n\n\n"

dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the \nfairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, \nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff \nSkilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.\n\nEnron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over \n350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the \nEnron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am \nchallenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain \namount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a \nbreak on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's \ncloser to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat \npledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge \nto this very worthy cause 1-1.\n\nI hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top \nmoney raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your \nconsideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.\n\nSherri x3-5984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the \nfairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, \nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff \nSkilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.\n\nEnron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over \n350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the \nEnron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am \nchallenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain \namount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a \nbreak on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's \ncloser to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat \npledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge \nto this very worthy cause 1-1.\n\nI hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top \nmoney raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your \nconsideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.\n\nSherri x3-5984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Also, we need to meet on Entex \nthis week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex \ncan account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these \nnominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.\n\nWe discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I \nthink we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to \nbe a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would \nbe to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve \ncommunication and establish more definitive criteria for changing \nnominations.  \n\nThe end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a \nsolution to past sins and a way forward.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Brenda F Herod                           09/25/2000 10:53 PM\n\t\n\nTo: James I Ducote/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A \nMartin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet H Wallis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nEdward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve HPL Schneider/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Yvette G Connevey/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: Coogler's Response\n\nPlease read the attached summary of Coogler's response to the audit \nfindings.

I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs \nto\nanswer.\n\n1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers \nis\n30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?\n2. Reliant claims that the \"New Technology Contract\" overrides  or is an\nexception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a\nlegitimate exception?\n3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the \nHouston\nDivision is under \"special contracts\" with special pricing, and even though \nthey\nare using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.\nDoes Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?\n4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for\nheating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total\ndivided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce\ndivided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are\nnot a new customer, or a customer that has left.\n5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the\nactual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite\n100 Mcf.\n\nThese are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that\nEnron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of\nthe special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If \nyou\nguys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and\nspoke about it.

Current estimates indicate that the \nloss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the \none remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than \noffset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to \nkeep everyone informed on this.\n\nRyan - This expected realized loss is exactly the situation which most \nconcerned us in the meeting with Patti this week.  Is there anything we can \ndo to push them towards resolving that timing of realized losses is \nirrelevent, and this is not an issue? "

As far as I am aware \nthere is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or \nEnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should \nnot execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in \nHouston.  \n\nFrom a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate \ntrading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for \nEnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the \nrequisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question \nfor ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  \n\nWhere a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market \nrisk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate \nthe mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact \nthat Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all \ncredit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than \nEnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA \nhas sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this \ninternal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of \nDeliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com \nwhich can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection \nfrom.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms \nregardless of the Enron booking entity.\n\nMark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly \nwhere I haven't hit the mark !).\n\ntks,\n\nDenis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Seyfried\n11/06/2000 13:57\nTo: Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\nIn reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should \nmatch across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two \nseparate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed \nout of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into \nEnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control \npersonnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.\n\nWe should try to close the open issues next week.

We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and \nuse the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there from \nHouston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get \nthere.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the \nweekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead \nof 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly \nmanage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - \nand it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't \nbe all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).  Plan B \nsounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean \nto go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!  What would you \nthink about heading down the Friday or Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and \nspending the first week of January there?  That assumes Bill can get that \nweek off and Amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later.

Is that something the three of us can work with?  \nAlternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving - \nwith amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).  \nI can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set in \nstone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.  I \nunderstand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of course \nthat does make New Year's eve a possibility.

I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went\nby so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few\ntravel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true\nparadise.\n\nI am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is\nthat my honeymoon has put me firmly in \"vacation deficit\" at the SEC.\nBarring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days\navailable by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has\ntold me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another\ntime.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How\nlong to you go for?\n\nKeep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny\nability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually\nevery vacation idea that people bring up.\n\nI'll be in touch,  Bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail, and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by the \naddressee(s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/or \nconfidential information.

He is expected to announce how bidding into the\nforward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs.\n\n     The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar\nfiling with federal regulators in the near future, sources said.\n\n     In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a\nmeasure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a\nmajority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of\nmarket power, the ISO has said in prior meetings.\n\n     Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators\ncan influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power\noccurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of\ngeneration ownership \"allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high\ndemand periods.\"\n\n     About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in\nthe spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO.\n\n     In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to\nenter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the\ndaily market price fluctuations.\n\n     Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a \"key\nsource of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,\" according to an ISO\nreport.\n\n     The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid\noperator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required\nto approve such an action.\n\n     EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action\n\n\n\n     The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to\nGary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board.\nHeath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news\nconference.\n\n     \"We're trying to find out what's behind this,\" Heath told Dow Jones\nNewswires. \"We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It\ncame as a surprise.\"\n\n     Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to\neclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month.\n\n     FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market\nthis past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably\ncompetitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have\nblamed the ISO for this summer's power woes.\n\n     -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00\n\n     0307GMT\n\n\n\n\nMichael E.

Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked \nwith a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on \ntransactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions \ninvolving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's \nelectricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, \nI started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on \ngeneral domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business \nentities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and \nsecurities offerings.

Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. "

This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.\nThey plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.\n\nOn other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.\n\nThe next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm. \n\nGC\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tMonday, October 29, 2001 5:10 PM\nTo:\tLawner, Leslie; Cantrell, Rebecca W.; Canovas, Guillermo; Pharms, Melinda\nCc:\tNicolay, Christi L.\nSubject:\tFW: November 1st Gas Issues Conference Call-- 3:30 p.m.\n\nCan someone please cover this meeting?  \n\nJim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Jackie Gallagher\" <JGallagher@epsa.org>@ENRON  \nSent:\tMonday, October 29, 2001 2:13 PM\nTo:\tacomnes@enron.com; Hawkins, Bernadette; Nersesian, Carin; Scheuer, Janelle; Hartsoe, Joe; jsteffe@enron.com; Noske, Linda J.; Robertson, Linda; Alvarez, Ray; Shapiro, Richard; Novosel, Sarah; Mara, Susan; Lindberg, Susan; Hoatson, Tom\nCc:\tNicolay, Christi L.; Fulton, Donna; Shelk, John; Cantrell, Rebecca W.\nSubject:\tNovember 1st Gas Issues Conference Call-- 3:30 p.m.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Regulatory Affairs Committee\n       Gas Issues Working Group\n\nFROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair\n            John Orr, Gas Issues Working Group Chair\n            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy\n            Jack Cashin, Senior Manager of Policy\n\nDATE: October 29, 2001\n\nRE: November 1st Gas Issues Conference Call\n      ?3:30 p.m. (EST)\n\nWe have scheduled a conference call of the Gas issues Working Group on Thursday, November 1st, at 3:30 p.m. (EST).

Also, one only needs to look back to \n1980-85 when rates in the Northwest went up 250% over a five year period \nbecause of nukes. This occurred in a fully regulated environment. \n\nThe problem is that many consumers do not have a true choice to secure a \nfixed price long-term contract. \n\nYou can not put the toothpaste back into the tube!  \n\nI hope Enron takes the high road on this issue and pushes for expedited \nsiting of new generation. The best way to accomplish this is to agree to \ncompliance with emissions standards and meeting off-sets where they exist. \nWhere off-sets do not exist, I think Enron can commit to paying for energy \nefficiency investments in partnership with utilities or industrial customers \nthat take the out-put (or take equity) at our new plants. \n\nPaying for conservation, which is running about 19-22 mills in the Northwest, \nis a pretty inexpensive way to accomplish good will with end-users and \nutilities.\n\n\n"

Going forward however, that is not an =\neffective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove =\nyour cost structure.\n\nIn speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convin=\nced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that=\n would help.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Portz, David =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, November 14, 2001 6:12 PM\nTo:=09Nicolay, Christi L.\nCc:=09Gilbert-smith, Doug; Baughman, Edward D.; Miller, Jeffrey; Forney, Jo=\nhn M.\nSubject:=09Ercot Questions OOMC & OOME\n\n\nForwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft=\n a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols =\nby the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the =\nOOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pa=\ny an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  Th=\ne OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=\nnder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=\ntion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =\nOOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=\nte value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=\nC/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=\ning the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =\nmarketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=\ned such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=\nE to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=\n. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=\nould be Reliability Must Run (\"RMR\") and be paid at an adequate premium for=\n their support of the system' reliability.\n\nI noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =\nthe interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =\nand we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=\niating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=\norrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =\nwe are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=\nn ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): \"thr=\neat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise=\n is not in compliance with these Protocols\".  Though the Protocols Sections=\n 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=\noducts that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=\no the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=\ndes' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=\non 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=\ntion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=\non stated by John Forney below.=20\n\nSorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for y=\nour group.\n  -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Forney, John M. =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, November 14, 2001 12:27 PM\nTo:=09Portz, David; Gilbert-smith, Doug\nSubject:=09Ercot Questions\n\n\n\nDavid,\nI need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:\n\nFrontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=\ntarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=\nds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.\nThe OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =\nis predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=\nla is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =\nzero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An=\n announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=\nut this week,  per Mark Patterson.\n\nThe second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=\nl energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =\na preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=\nrotocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services=\n with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=\npirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.\n\n  =20\nHere is the problem:\nthe head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols=\n to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=\natchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were=\n not generating into the grid.\nWe explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=\nns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =\nfor the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=\ncot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=\nun by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=\nc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.\n\nI sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=\nis issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=\ncot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at=\n their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=\nc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =\nfor Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=\nd receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark=\n also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=\nne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me \"dont worry,=\n  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=\nst money.\"\n\n\n\nHere is my view:\nOOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =\nErcot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.\nErcot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =\na group supposedly unconcerned with price.\nIf OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=\nME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =\nimbalance.\nOOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=\nement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.\nWhy would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=\npes of filing for a \"breakeven.\"   Ridiculous.\n\nI spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had \"no comment=\n\" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has \"no comme=\nnt.\"\nBill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=\nsure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same=\n path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =\nreceive.\n\nI had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=\ne to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=\nrcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =\nto control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=\nw was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =\nErcot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=\nance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.\nErcot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=\nployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=\ne issue, not a protocol issue.  =20\nWe worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=\nled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full=\n load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =\nthe unit.    Ercot said that \" it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=\nquest to be compensated in the form of an OOME.\"\nThe Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=\nstruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=\nuction on a regular basis?\n\nFinally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via=\n OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=\nvironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=\nonell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for \"forcing them to=\n OOME our plant.\"\n\nCan I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, =\n what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJForney\n37160\n\n"

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \naddtional gas supplies.\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \nany one time.\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \nable to help out here).\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \napproach with generators.\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's \nthoughts and get them to Kari)\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \nnot just the 5 one year strips.\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \ndeal.\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \nforward contracting issues.\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.\n\n\n\n"

Vanek will apparently send me some of the documentation I \nrequested, although it is not clear that he will send me the documents that \nreflect that all the loads for which Scottsborough is being sued were in fact \npurchased from MG Metals.\n\nMy last question on my telefax to Vanek was what attorney Vanek would \ntypically retain in a lawsuit such as this to defend Scottsborough.  Vanek \nsaid in his voice-mail that in this suit, he does not intend to hire an \nattorney.  Vanek said he would pay whatever the carrier was suing for, then \ndeduct that amount from whatever Scottsborough owes us for aluminum.  Then, \ncontradicting himself, Vanek said that he would join MG Metals as a party \n(which would of course require him to retain an attorney).  I assume that he \nprobably could join us as a party on a breach of contract theory, given that \nScottsborough purchased the metal from us \"freight prepaid\".   I'm not sure \nthat an Alabama court has personal jurisdiction over Enron Metals sufficient \nto allow joinder, but it might.\n\nVanek also seemed irritated at the time MG Metals had taken to reply to his \nearlier communications, and directed me to our Montreal office if I wanted \ncopies of things he had previously sent to us.  Of course, we all decided \nsome time ago to take a \"let sleeping dogs lie\" strategy in hopes that a \ncarrier like Alabama wouldn't actually file suit.  In any case, I don't know \nhow much of this apparent irritation is real or is strategy.\n\nI called Vanek back and again missed him, but left a voice-mail to the effect \nthat I read his message \"loud and clear\" and would jump on reviewing the \nexhibits he was sending me as soon as I received them.  I told him that I was \nparticularly interested in them because if the bs/l were marked \"freight \nprepaid\", then Scottsborough may have a good defense to the carrier's case.\n\nAs you may recall, ICTS has been joined as a party to this action.  ICTS is \nthe party that didn't pay the carrier.  I try to call ICTS and see what it \nintends to do in this matter.   \n\nBritt"

Per discussions with Sara, we need to ascertain whether \nMS will hold the ADR's in a security account in the name of the Enron  Brazil \nPower Holding XII on behalf of PEP. \n\nI just looked at the legal ownership of PEP and noted that there is another \nBrazilian limitada, SPE between Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII and PEP.  I \nassume that we will have filings for two capital reductions, one for PEP and \none for SPE unless SPE was removed from the ownership chain and that \ntransaction has not been reflected in the Corporate Secretary data base.  SPE \nwas placed in the chain of owenrship for the Comgas bid and I am not sure \nwhether it got removed when we recycled the entity.\n\nLynn\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Harris\n01/18/2000 05:05 AM\nTo: Robert H George/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Pedro Henrique Oliveira/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kent \nCastleman/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Lynn \nAven/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bruce \nHarris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Re: Millenium ADR(s)  \n\nIf MS can do it thats great.

The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the \"no material litigation\" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.\n\n2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.\n\n \nCan we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.\n\n3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?   \n\nThanks\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tEvans, Mark (London Legal)  \nSent:\t01 November 2001 21:49\nTo:\tHaedicke, Mark E.; Walls Jr., Rob\nSubject:\tENRON EUROPE\n\n\nMark, Rob\n\nMy apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.\n\nEnron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: \n\n1. Continuing to trade\n\nThe directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. \n\nThe directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  \n\nI would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. \n\n\n2. Filing accounts\n\nThe directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. \n\nI should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? \n\nWe now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? \n\n\nThat's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. \n\nMany thanks.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark\n\n\n\n "

As I understand it, there are two types of county ad valorem taxes that might be relevant in this lawsuit:  a tax on reserves in the ground pre-production, which is typically paid by the producer, and a tax on gas that has been produced and then stored in some sort of storage facility in that county (although I didn't ask, I again assume that the owner of the gas in the storage facility or the owner of the gas storage facility pays that tax).\n\n\tIf I recall correctly, you advised me that none of the three Enron defendants named (Enron Corp., Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. and Intratex) had paid either of these two types of ad valorem taxes back as far as your records show.  I am hoping that you can say that based on your records, none of these entities owned any reserves in Zapata County or stored in gas in Zapata County or owned any storage facilities in Zapata County (whatever the relevant question is) for as far back as your records go (I recall you mentioning that none of these entities stored gas in Zapata County, but I can't remember if I asked you if I also asked you to confirm that none of these entities owned any gas reserves in Zapata and I don't know how far back your records go).\n\n\t(Of course, if I have gotten any of this wrong or mischaracterized what you've said, please let me know).\n\n\tIf I haven't worn out my welcome, would you be the right person to be able to sign an affidavit supporting the foregoing?

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES \nRetail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals \nstay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate \nor do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for \nCES?  This could be a can of worms. \n\nColleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production \ndeals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? \nAre the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. \nMaybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the \nofficial word.\n\nCurrently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate \ndelivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to \nEnron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the \nsystem to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently \nthe market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The \npathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to \nthe market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be \nincreased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany \nhas been creating.\n\nHowever if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot \nof unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Katherine L Kelly @ ECT                           03/13/2000 10:34 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: CES Pool Gas\n\nHey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are \nTCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these \nwere all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that \nCES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like \nthis on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy \nfrom whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  \nChris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right \nnow he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little \nconfused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the \npool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  \n\nWade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?

When the cake says \"Happy  Birthday Mijo\" instead of the child's real \nname.\n3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, \ncake, and a pinata.\n4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.\n5.??? It's \"Mijo's\" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz \ncon frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.\n6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, \nthere is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.\n7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.\n8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.\n9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.\n10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and \nget some tortillas and ice.\n11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.\n12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say \"Mira, tan cute!\"\n13.??? Someone else says? \"I'm  going to have to get you something next week \nwhen I get paid.\n14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday \nnight saying, \"I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.\"\n15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.\n16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.\n17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new \nhouse and he has a pool.\n18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the \ncomadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.\n19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food \nwith, so you can eat you  cake.\n20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save \nthem some cake.\n21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el \nJunior.\n22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.\n23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.\n24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he \nhad before and after the Birthday  Baby.\n25.??? It's \"Mijo's\" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her \nbirthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.\n?\nPower to la Raza\n?\nI thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those \nwho are still trying to get to know  us..........\n\n?\n\n\n"

Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. \n \nWe have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  \n \nThe problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:\n \nDoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70\n \nI temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.\n \nI guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.\n \nJCP\n \n \nJuan Carlos P?rez Bofill, ME\nEnvironmental Engineer\nVincenty, Heres & Lauria\nP.O.

Both\nof those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, a\nunit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.\n  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.\n(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company\nelectricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotels\nin California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E.\n\n  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel\npower at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWh\nStarwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August.\n\n  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said it\nexpects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10\nyears.\n\n  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., will\npurchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its\nexperience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E for\nuse of their distribution networks.\n\n  \"That really is our core strength,\" said Harold Buchanan, chief operating\nofficer for Enron Energy Services North America. \"We understand how to manage\nthose risks.\"\n\n  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch\n\n  The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback\nof sorts for Enron.\n\n  The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail power\nmarket just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise\nthe venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residential\ncustomers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected\nprofits.\n\n  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of\npromise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in\nCalifornia, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.\n\n  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego\nthat have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are\ninterested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.\n\n  \"Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that's\nwritten in stone,\" Buchanan said. \"It's far cheaper than what they're paying\nnow with the utilities.\"\n\n  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to\ncomment.\n\n  The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract\nwith Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years\nat $49 per megawatt-hour.\n\n  Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building and\noperating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials\nexpect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.\n\n  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price\nspikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June.\n\n  San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity service\nfor its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council said\ncould shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has said\nit would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.\n\n  An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports such\narrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.\n\n  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for four\nyears at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was too\nhigh.\n\n  California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap\nelectricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.\n\n\n  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nFolder Name: Enron Energy Services\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 80\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTo review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or \ncontact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com \nor by phone at 800-369-7466.

He should be \nhere for the management \nconference.\n\n\nVince\n\n\n\nFrom: Cindy Derecskey@ENRON on 10/11/2000 01:30 PM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael B Rosen/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Power Play Book\n\nGood afternoon Vince,\n\nChristie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently \nattended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her \nrecently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter \nEnron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones \nand I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble \nyour wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow \nmy search.\n\nI greatly appreciate it.\n\nRegards,\n\nCindy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are drafting a \"pitch letter\" to send out by the end of this week\nvia blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps\nreporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)\ntrade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our\npitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I\ncustomers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are\nsuffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will\naddress the effect on California's future business climate if direct access\nis not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x\ncaused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no\nmatter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a\npart of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate\nCalifornia businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a\nprime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.\n\n2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access\nCoalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press\nstrategy outlined here.\n\n3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to\ntake media calls on behalf of the coalition.\n\nNext Week\n\n1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.\n\n2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an\nopportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.\nMonitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be\neffective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending\na media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after\nthe hearing.\n\n3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.\n\n4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California\nCapitol Week and the California Report) to secure\nmedia interviews.\n\n5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of\nthe amended language in SB 27x.\n\n What We Need From You\n\n1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have\ncustomers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please\nrespond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact\ninformation.\n\n2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers\non behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to\ndo this for the you.\n\n3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the\nmedia it would be helpful to have this information so that we can\ncollaborate as necessary.\n\nThe Documents Below\n>  All documents are works in progress, so if you have suggestions on\n> potential changes, please feel free to share them with us.\n>\n\nThank you.\n\n>  <<AREM Fact Sheet 2212001 ver 2272001.doc>>\n>  <<Q&A @ ESP Reversions 22701.doc>>  <<AReM FAQ FINAL3.doc>>  <<AREM Fact\n> FINAL3.doc>>\n>\n> Tracy Fairchild\n> Account Supervisor\n> Edelman Public Relations Worldwide\n> (916) 442-2331\n> tracy.fairchild@edelman.com\n>\n\n - AREM Fact Sheet 2212001 ver 2272001.doc\n - Q&A @ ESP Reversions 22701.doc\n - AReM FAQ FINAL3.doc\n - AREM Fact FINAL3.doc"

Here's what we \nfound out...\n\nSteve's question:\n\nWhat economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New \nMexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us \nexpanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?\n\nWhat you're really asking here is \"What are the comparative economics of \nenergy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?\"  In this \nanalysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to \nconstruct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including \nenergy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. \n\n Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines \nand tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct \nturnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile \"rule of thumb\" we use \nfor turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36\") high-pressure steel \npipeline.  \n\nIn terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are \nthree (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) \ntransformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the \nconductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This \nnumber is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on \nTranswestern's pipeline.   \n\nThe most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission \nlines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission \nlines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an \nelectric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could \ntake anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of \nelectromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along \nwith other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in \nsecuring permits for right-of-way.\n\nIn short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be \ncomparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and \nelectric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric \ntransmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate \nreturns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.\n\n\nDrew's questions:\n\n1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts \nhis plant?\n\nFor purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired \ngeneration.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding \nwhere to site a new electric power plant:\n 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market\n 2. Water rights for turbine cooling\n 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local \nregulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)\n 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  \n\n\n2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various \nutilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much \nthe same all over?\n\nFERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of \nconduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and \nbetween other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  \nFERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission \naccess and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate \ntheir transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant \nfunctions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under \nFERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's \npretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with \nrespect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual \nstates, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of \nIndependent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for \nimprovement (and possible further FERC involvement).\n \n\"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a \nsingle pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of \nservice to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission \nservice.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate \ntransmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro \nforma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own \nwholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the \nfull recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred \nto serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use \nopen access to move to another supplier.\"  \n\n\n3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy \nbundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. \nseparately)?\n\nIn my experience, there is no \"one size fits all\" formula or strategy.  For \nexample, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to \nsupplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out \nof several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground \nand dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged \nthe gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the \npurchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western \nU.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders \nare satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation \nto the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ \ntransportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics \nand secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas \nsupply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala \nCalpine.\n\n\n4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?\n\nLast December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional \nTransmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of \nOrders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, \nOrder 2000 makes \"a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations \nfrom the influence of electricity market participants.\"  Therefore, Order \n2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the \nfunctional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization \nof the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional \nboundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of \nprivately-owned transmission companies.  \n\nFERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order \ninitiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The \nOrder also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned \"public \nutilities\" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private \nutilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate \nthe needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally \nowned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer \nthe following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused \nby structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in \ntransmission grid management through better pricing and congestion \nmanagement, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities \nfor discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase \ncoordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) \nfacilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate \nlighter-handed regulation. \n\nCritics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO \nformation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers \nfor case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved \nin order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel \nany transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance \nand incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of \nfurther consequences for the hold-outs. \n\nAs to the final part of the question (\"why should we care?\"), presumably, the \ndevelopment of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the \nefficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As \nFERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and \nutility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission \nsystem.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and \nthe ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, \nsources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately \ncripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  \n\n\n5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?\n\nNatural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only \"kill\" gas-fired power plants in \nthose instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural \ngas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side \nmanagement or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly \nprohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, \nparticularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel \nfor electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than \n5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give \nfuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu \nprice).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make \nthe installation of new electric generation based on anything other than \nnatural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand \nside management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting \nresource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in \noffsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable \nto comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the \nuse of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven Harris\n10/26/2000 10:05 AM\nTo: Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron\ncc: Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON \n\nSubject: Re: Electric Developments  \n\nSince you are the \"expert\" in this area, I need to know what economics would \ndetermine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe \n3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to \ndeliver the gas to a power plant in California.

We all had a first lesson \non this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and \nKevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent \ndevelopments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power \ngeneration load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the \nfollowing:\n1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer \nputs his plant?  \n2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various \nutilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much \nthe same all over? \n3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy \nbundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  \nseparately)?\n4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? \n5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?\n Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a \nfollow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  \nDF\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants\n2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities\n3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction\n\nThe tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)\n\nThey also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.\n\nSome of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be:\n\n- How much capacity is truly \"idling\" and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output?\n- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation?\n- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA?\n\nWe will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders, but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner.\n\nD-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates \n  \nCEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators. \n- limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w 06/01-10/01/01 \n\nExpedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.\n\nAccelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants.\n\nAction by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.\n\nRequirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power.\n\nExpires  12/31/01 unless extended\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive air quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  \n\nD-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements\n\nISO Requirements:\n- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO\n- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly\n- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities\n- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board\n- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO\n- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO\n\nRequires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO's ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand.\n\nInstructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.\n\nRequires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. benchmarks for availability and performance, and issue fines against those plants, after a hearing.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nAgain, the tone of this order is that the state won't tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where off-line for maintenance at the same time.\n\nD-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures\n\nMandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate.\n- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits\n- If air districts do not comply, the Board (CARB?) shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts\n\nThe Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources:\n- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in 2001\n- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources, CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction,\n- In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity, emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available.\n- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located.\n\nExpires 12/31/2001 unless extended\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified, including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However, it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level.\n\nD-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants\n\nExpedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.\n\nAuthorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.\n\nRequires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification, and for the construction phase of the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification.\n\nExpires 12/31/01 unless extended\n\nAnalysis\n\nAgain, no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner.\n\nD-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources\n\nRequires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and that are proposed to be on line by summer 2001.\n\n Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:\n- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July 31, 2001.\n-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process.\n-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months, shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August 31, 2002  and that have an application for certification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.\n-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants, emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification\n-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.\n\nIOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt of completed application.\n\nExpires 12/31/01 unless extended.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units."

Those changes \nare redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 \nas well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to \nexhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they \ntypically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it \nanyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined \ncycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, \nthen they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and \ntheir defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust \nguarantees.  Let me know what they decide.\n\nExhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to \nyour file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I \ntherefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a \nseparate word file. \n\nExhibit F is \"boiler plate\" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit \"U\" is not in my \nhard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit \"T.\"   If you get something from \nGE on Exhibit \"U\", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  \n\nIf you have questions, give me a call.

Coincidentally \nThursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged \nDay though.\n\nActually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting \ntogether for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and \nJonathan Whitehead.\n\nThanks and sorry for the trouble.\n\nJane \n\n\n\n\n\n\tSara Shackleton@ECT\n\t11/09/2000 12:48 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@ENRON\n\t\t cc: John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark \nTaylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jonathan \nWhitehead/AP/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: Re: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT - 1. Credit matrix and 2. Threshold \namount \n\nJane:\n\nIf you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's \nview of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a \nratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally \na MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event \ntriggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).\n\nI am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the \noffice after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  \nAlternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston \ntime on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.

Credit matrix and 2. Threshold \namount \n\nDear John,\n\nJonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to \nthe end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly \ntheir back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in \nplace which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They \nacknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards \nCSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did \nsay though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do \nso. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are \nset up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask \nthem to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.\n\nWe will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you \nare still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess \nthis means US$15 million credit limit.  \n\nOn the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract \nwithout a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be \nable to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the \ndrafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     \n\nMost of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the \n\"Threshold Amount\" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on \nthis?\n\nThanks.\n\nJane McBride\n\n\n\n\n\tJohn Suttle@ECT\n\t09/27/2000 12:39 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Jonathan Whitehead/AP/Enron@ENRON\n\t\t cc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kevin \nCordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E \nPettersen/AP/Enron@Enron, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom \nBruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT\n\nJonathan,\n\nOne thing we might be able to propose is a \"Credit Matrix\" which prescribes a \nCredit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral \nrights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each \ncounterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and \nthey are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) \nclauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot \nautomatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We \nare comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, \nthe amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to \nIBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is \nit possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without \nusing a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a \nCSA).\n\nRating (S&P)     Credit Line\nAA or above    $20MM\nBBB+ to AA-    $15MM\nBBB     $10MM\nBBB-     $7MM\nBB- to BB+    $5MM\nBelow BB-    $1MM\n\nThese terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC \nclauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively \nreduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with \ndiminishing credit quality.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM\n\nTo: John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kevin \nCordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E \nPettersen/AP/Enron@Enron, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom \nBruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT  \n\nSorry, Pressed send too early:\n\nJohn, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to \nconsider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet \nwith them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to \noffer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit \nthe types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we \nwould be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at \nthis stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am \nnot sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite \nwilling to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a \nrenegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. \nI also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on \ntrades if we do not have a CSA?\n\nThanks,\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n\tJohn Viverito\n\t09/22/2000 12:04 PM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron@ECT, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@ENRON@ECT, \nJonathan.Whitehead@enron.com, Kevin Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark \nTaylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E Pettersen/AP/Enron@Enron@ECT, Steven \nKleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT\n\nJohn-\n\nDuring our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of \nthe CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the \nrequisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize \nsame with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our \nview on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in \nour recent conference call.  \n\nIBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial \ninstitution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the \nfirst.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective \nsuperiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this \nissue was \"In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral \noperations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.\"  The legitimacy of this \nstatement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be \nsomething entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do \nnot want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  \n\nWe will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, \nhowever it is uncertain if this is achievable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the\nsky. About 70 degrees.\n11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.\n11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.\n12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second\nfloor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).\nWe're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the\nstreet right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of\nTexas. AWESOME MOMENT.\n12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests\nwith one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the\nfact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.\n1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot\nand holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below\nus to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.\n*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced\nthat we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.\n1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the\n\"Traveler\" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.\n1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am\ntaunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of\nNebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play\n what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\"\nRemember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska\njackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell\n phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta\nBowl.\n And then I spoke these memorable words: \"And not those damn refundable\ntickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable\nsons-of-bitches!\" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines\nand buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:\n $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in\n triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my\n subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I\n RULE the pre-game kingdom.\n2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my\nfirst stiffy.\n2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.\nNebraska is very pissed off at Texas.\n3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.\nZero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy\n from the Traveler.\n3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.\n\nI buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in\nline, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the\nend zone. Safety.\n3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.\n4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I\nattempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\n\"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock.\" He is unamused.\n4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my\nbeer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are\nequipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so\nthat we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch\nof pussies.\n4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.\n\nI purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.\n5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This\nnormally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.\n5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been\nconfirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.\"\n5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.\nAs it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when\nthere is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this\npolicy. I ask loudly: \"Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the\nfucking PA system??!!\"\n5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,\nthe Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter, awaking from my\ncoma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\" Alas, the answer is no, we were not\nwinning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from\nthe\nTexas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel\nand Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters \"S\", \"K\",\nand \"A\" in the \"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.\n\nI pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.\n6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would\ntaunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too\ndrunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the\nevening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in\nOctober, they would be playing Florida State for the national\nchampionship.\n6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona\ntip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.\n\nI don't care.\n7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk\npast the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's\nany good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the\nZima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.\n7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients\nare, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean\nover the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.\n\nI am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately\ntwo\npounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.\nThe patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.\n8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing\nBrooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my\nsinging. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good\nsongs besides \"You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" and\nthat maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit\nexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.\n\nI tell him to fuck off and restart \"Neon Moon.\"\n8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and\nprofane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.\n\nI\ntell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may\nas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed\nabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon Moon\" loudly.\n8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to\nkick the shit out of Arizona.\n9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the\nbathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the\nnew opportunity to do \"the bathroom Brice.\" There are no Arizona fans in the\nbathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a\n\"Niiiiiice cock.\" No one is amused but me.\n9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless\nto say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out\n\nof\na can. I am stopped by an usher: \"Where did you get that, sir?\" I tell him\n(no shit): \"Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little\nplastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?\" I take the\nlast swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the\nbathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to\navoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of\npeople and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a\nlittle girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.\n9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I\nhave no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.\n10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out\nthe seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the\nsurrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I\nshouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.\n10:15 After the fourth consecutive \"worst fucking call I have EVER seen,\" I\nattempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,\non this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,\nleaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left\neye and all over my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to myself, \"I'm taking this a\nbit seriously.\"\n10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and\ngrunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are\nbloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look\nlike I should be in an episode of Cops.\n10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make\nmy way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good\nsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I\nmerely grunt incoherently and keep moving.\n10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six\nflights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the\nface for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and\ncollapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and\n\nno one is moving. I take a nap.\n11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my\nhead to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up\nall the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I\nam too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"\n11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"\n11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"\n11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and\n\nno one is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"\n11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed\nof the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second\nfloor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,\nand pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me\nlike I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the\nfront of his truck while singing the lyrics to \"Neon Moon.\"\n12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from\nvehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to\nmy vehicle.\n12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my\napartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of\nGlenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die\ntonight.\n12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide\nit would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.\nHe walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length\n mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We\ngiggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.\n1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter\nhis club. \"Fellas,\" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, \"I've\n been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this\ntown for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen\nthree drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in.\" We\nattempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.\n1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear\n\"Last call for alcohol!\" I turn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat wasn't\nthat fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the\nalab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today...\" We order 6 shots of tequila\nand three beers.\n2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and\none half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell\nhim to keep it.\n2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated\nimmediately.\n2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two\norders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese\nstuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.\n2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The\nwaiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the\nrestaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is\n$112 with tip.\n2:46 I'm sleepy.\n9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.\nShe is not pretty.\n> >\n>\n\n - att1.htm\n\n\n\n\n"

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors \nCaramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations \nby Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made \nthe following points:\nThere isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in \nthe wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would \nhurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West \nas well.\nHigh prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does \nanything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised \nby any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still \nincenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level \nequal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  \nThe IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by \nscarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, \ntherefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time \nprices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund \nas an asset allocation scheme.\nThe market would function better if more information was provided to the \nmarket.\nThe Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.\nTo see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, \nyou will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oral \npresentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional \ninformation.\n\nAccording to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot \nmore out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the \ngenerators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff \nis looking into the data we provided.  \n\nI have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to \nScott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a \ndifferent approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott \nand answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of \neliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be \nable to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of \nscarcity .  \n \n"

Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of \nEnron.\n\nRegards,\nTim\n\nNew Cap Specifics\nOn 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a \nnew price cap methodology.\nThe new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as \ncan be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to \nachieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date \nmight be.\nThe new price cap methodology will remain in place until:\nComprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven \nto be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.\nEither FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.\nCap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the \nfollowing heat rate table:\n  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap\n  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10\n  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70\n  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90\n  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90\n  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh\nCaps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.\nDemand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.\nThe ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior \nto the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead \nsystem load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior \nto the hour of delivery.\n\nFERC Context\nFERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.\nThe ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid \ncap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of \nelectricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.\nThe ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  \nFERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days \nafter their authority expires)\nFERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its \n206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know \nwhat they will find or what they will propose.\nThe proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will \nlikely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on \n11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral \ncomments.\nMany companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price \ncaps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.\nIt is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into \neffect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC \nextends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from \nthe current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.\n\nImpact of Price Caps\nThe attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at \ndifferent gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets \nwould clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to \nsay whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap \nbecause we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the \ncap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.\nTake actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   \nCalculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new \nprice cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.\nDivide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.\nCalculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  \nFor example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January \nthrough September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January \nthrough September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 \nfrom each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual \nobservations.\nWe created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the \ncalculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices \nfor each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each \nhour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour \ncould be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly \naverage cap value!\nThe blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 \nNYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power \nprices which are in excess of the proposed cap.\n\n\n\n\n"

Some of Bob's concerns are covered by current DealBench \nagreements (e.g., site license and access agreements).  \n\nToday, Bob, Mark Taylor and I discussed possible EOL exchange related issues \ninvolved in a DealBench/EOL auction relationship.  The analysis may be \ncomplicated by unrelated DealBench exchange issues raised by other DealBench \nbusiness plans.  Based upon a subsequent discussion with Suresh this \nafternoon, EOL exchange issues may be alleviated by latest plan to include a \nseparate DealBench powered area within EOL for auctions with a link to \nDealBench merely for PR purposes (rather than a link from EOL to DealBench \nfor EOL auctions to be conducted on DealBench).  Other unrelated exchange \nissues noted in outline may still need to be resolved depending upon \nDealBench business plans.  \n\nAs Suresh and I discussed, we need to further discuss some of the issues \nraised in the outline as DealBench business plans further develop.  Please \nkeep in mind that we (legal) may need some lead time to resolve issues, \nparticularly if regulatory authorities are involved (e.g, we decide to seek \nSEC or CFTC no-action relief).  \n\nRegards, NJD\n\nNora J.

I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of \nthe Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option \nPremiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of \nthe transformers.\n\nRegards, Lisa\n---------------------- Forwarded by Lisa Bills/Corp/Enron on 07/05/2000 08:45 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nMatthew Berry@ECT\n07/05/2000 02:43 PM\nTo: Lisa Bills/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \n\nSubject: ABB Agreement for Review\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Matthew Berry/HOU/ECT on 07/05/2000 03:42 \nPM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Kay Mann @ ENRON                           07/05/2000 02:36 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Herman Manis/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Matthew Berry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carl \nTricoli/Corp/Enron@Enron, Thomas M Suffield/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Matthew F \nGockerman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: ABB Agreement for Review\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract.

At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to \nuse a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to \nchange MG's status.\n\nPer the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK \n\"arranger\" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where \nthe business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike \nHutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical \nsolutions:\n\n1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco \nInc.\n2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd \n(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).\n\nThe current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK \nand Switzerland.\n\nPlease advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision.

Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.\n\n1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? \n\n2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) \n\nWhen you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nKim"

Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  \nAs result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) \n2.\tThe employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.     \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tClark, Mary  \nSent:\tSunday, November 25, 2001 6:49 PM\nTo:\tJones, Robert W.- HR Exec\nCc:\tOxley, David; Cash, Michelle; James, Terrie; Denne, Karen; Johnson, Rick\nSubject:\tA few questions about the scripts\n\nI have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me\n\n1.

I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.\n\nI expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.\n\nCall if you have questions or concerns.

Paul Dawson will become head of the group taking responsibility for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.\n\nI believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe\n\netc\n\nMichael Brown\"\n\nHope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.

The\nStrong Opinions were 0-4 last week, but remember, I DO NOT BET THE STRONG OPINIONS.\nStrong Opinions have won more than they have lost over the years (about 54% to 55%), but\nplay them at your own risk (I don't want to here about if they lose. Or win, for that\nmatter). There are 10 Strong Opinions this week, listed below the Best Bets. Good luck on\nthe 6 Best Bets this week.\n\n3 Star Selection\nIOWA (-14.0) 38 Miami Ohio 14\nAfter suffering through a 7-27 record the last 3 seasons, the Hawkeyes will be in the\nhunt for a bowl bid this year. Iowa returns 16 starters from a team that was hit hard by\ninjuries last season and they are eager to flex their muscles on lesser teams, as they\ndid last week in beating Kent State 51-0. Miami-Ohio is certainly a tougher test than\nKent, but the Hawkeyes should have no trouble disposing of the Redhawks. Iowa has a well\nrounded offense that is anchored by a veteran offensive line and that possesses a quality\nquarterback in Kyle McCann, a talented running back in Ladell Betts and a game-breaking\nreceiver in Kahill Hill that is due for a breakout season. Iowa ran for 331 yards at 6.8\nyards per rush last week against a Kent State defensive front that I rate the same as\nMiami-Ohio's, so I expect another good performance from the Iowa rush attack in this game\nwhile McCann picks apart a sub-par Miami secondary when he needs to. Miami-Ohio possesses\na pretty solid rush attack and they ran for 127 yards at 4.4 ypr against Michigan last\nweek, but Iowa is solid up front on defense and the Redhawks don't have the passing\nprowess to take advantage of a mediocre Hawkeyes secondary. Miami averaged just 6.2 yards\nper pass last season with a seasoned quarterback and new starter, redshirt freshman Ben\nRoethlisberger, averaged just 5.5 yards per pass last week against Michigan while getting\npicked off 3 times. Iowa held Kent's poor pass attack to just 90 yards in 32 passes last\nweek (2.8 ypp), so they are capable of shutting down poor passing teams. Teams that were\n3-8 or worse the previous year usually perform very well in game 2 after a victory in\ntheir opener, so expect Iowa to be very enthusiastic for this game. The Hawkeyes also\nqualify in a 31-7 ATS home favorite momentum situation as long as they remain favored by\n18 points or less.<p>\n<b>Downgrade Iowa to a 2-Star if they become a favorite of more than 14 points.\nPass if Iowa is favored by more than 18 points.</b>\n\n\n3 Star Selection\nPITTSBURGH (-21.0) 35 S. Florida 3\nPittsburgh will have one of the best defenses in the nation this year as they return 10\nstarters from a unit that gave up just 2.6 ypr and 6.6 ypp last season. The Panthers\nopened the season with a 31-0 win over Division 1AA East Tennessee State and now take on\na South Florida team that played Division 1AA last season. South Florida was a pretty\ndecent 7-4 in the lower division last year, but they return just 8 starters for their\nmove to Division 1A. The Bulls are led by talented quarterback Marquel Blackwell, who\nthrew for a mediocre 6.8 yards per pass last year but tossed only 4 interceptions while\nrunning for 566 yards at 4.4 ypr. Blackwell threw for 7.0 ypp last week against a poor\nNorthern Illinois secondary and lost yardage on the ground. While Blackwell is a decent\nDivision 1AA quarterback, he will not fare so well against a tougher schedule and will be\nharassed by fierce Pittsburgh pass rush that registered 7 sacks last week. Without much\ntime to throw, I doubt that Blackwell will be able to find open receivers against a\nsticky Pitt secondary. South Florida doesn't have a rush attack and (51 yards on 30\nrushes last week against Northern Illinois) Pitt only allowed 2.6 ypr, so Blackwell will\nbe put in some unfavorable passing situations in this game and I doubt that he'll lead\nhis team to more than one score (if they score at all). Pittsburgh's offense is hurt by\nthe absence of All-American WR Antonio Bryant, who missed last week's game and is listed\nas doubtful this week. Pitt is still a better than average offense without Bryant as\nquarterback David Priestly has put up solid numbers in his two years as a part-time\nstarter (8.2 yards per pass) and he should perform well enough in this game to put up\nenough points to cover the favorable pointspread (opened at 25 and has come down). Pitt\nbeat East Tennessee State 31-0 last week, out-gaining them 414 yards to 180 yards. East\nTennessee was rated about 4 points worse than South Florida last season and South Florida\nis not as good this year with just 8 returning starters. In other words, Pitt is laying\njust 21 points against a team that is very similar talent-wise to the East Tennessee\nState team that they beat by 31 points last week. Perhaps the spread dropped when it was\nreported that Bryant would not play again this week. However, that news was already in\nthe opening line and I would have played the Panthers at that higher number. The Pitt\ndefense will dominate again this week and winning by 3 touchdowns or more should not be a\nproblem.\n\n3 Star Selection\nTEMPLE 17 Toledo (-7.5) 16\nTemple returns an amazing 20 starters from a team that took major strides last season and\nI expect them to make it to a bowl game this year. The Owls were 4-7 last year and lost 3\ngames by 7 points or less (all their wins were by comfortable margins), so they were\nactually better than last year's record indicates. Toledo, meanwhile, returns 15 starters\nfrom a team that was 10-1 last year and they destroyed Minnesota 38-7 last week at home.\nThat big win will give us some line value here and I have no problem taking a Temple team\nthat is capable of containing Toledo's Chester Taylor, who is coming off a year in which\nhe rushed for 1470 yards at 5.9 ypr and ran for 186 yards last week against Minnesota.\nTemple has an outstanding defensive front 7 that yielded just 3.4 ypr last year and will\nbe even better this year with 10 starters back on defense. The Owls were dominating up\nfront last week, holding Navy's option rush attack to just 49 yards on 31 rushes, and\nthey are good enough to limit Taylor's yardage today. Toledo quarterback Tavares Bolden\naveraged just 5.6 yards per pass last season and just 6.0 ypp last week against a poor\nMinnesota secondary, so limiting the run ought to be enough to limit the Rockets'\noffense. Last season, Toledo averaged just 19 points against the 2 good defensive teams\nthat they faced (Penn State and Western Michigan) and Temple should be able to hold them\nin that range today. The Owls' offense will have a tough time against a very good Toledo\ndefense, but Temple ran for 285 yards at 5.3 ypr last week against a decent Navy run\ndefense and they did that without star running back Tanardo Sharps, who was nursing an\ninjury in order to be ready for this week's game (he's listed as probable). Sharps ran\nfor over 1000 yards last year at a very healthy 5.2 ypr clip and he will be eager to play\nwell with another top running back on the opposite sideline. Toledo allowed just 2.5 ypr\nlast season but they faced only one better than average rushing team last season and that\nteam, Northern Illinois, ran averaged 4.6 ypr and scored 24 points against the Rockets.\nLast week, Toledo allowed 3.4 ypr to a mediocre Minnesota rush attack, so I expect Temple\nto run the ball fairly well in this game. Temple won't have to score too many points to\ncover the generous pointspread since their defense ought to keep Toledo's scoring down\nand the Owls qualify in a number of great situations today. Temple qualifies in a 54-15-1\nATS home underdog momentum situation and a 33-7 ATS statistical indicator. My ratings\nfavor Toledo by 3 points but I'll call for the outright upset by Temple given the great\nsituations that they are in.\n<p><b>\nDowngrade Temple to a 2-Star Best Bet if they become an underdog of less than 7\npoints.</b>\n\n\n3 Star Selection\nWashington St. (-4.5) 35 BOISE ST. 21\nThe Cougars gave us an easy 3-Star Best Bet winner last week in their 36-7 win over Idaho\nand I will call on them again to deliver another winner tonight. Washington State's\nbalanced, potent offense should have another easy time moving the football as they face a\nBoise State defense that returns just 3 starters from a unit that is just average against\nthe run and terrible defending the pass. Boise faced just 4 average or better passing\nattacks last season and they allowed 322 passing yards per game at 7.8 ypp in those\ngames, including allowing Washington State to throw for 290 yards at 9.4 ypp in a 35-42\nloss. Boise is even worse in the secondary this year with the loss of 3 All-Conference\ndefensive backs from that unit. South Carolina completed 69% of their passes against\nBoise last week for 8.5 yards per pass and I expect similar results from Gesser this\nweek. Boise State scored 35 points in their loss to the Cougars last season, but the\nBroncos are far less dangerous on offense with the departure of 4 year starting\nquarterback Bart Hendricks, who averaged an incredible 9.6 yards per pass last year with\na 36-9 TD to interception ratio. New quarterback Ryan Dinwiddle averaged just 5.2 yards\nper pass against South Carolina last week and this week faces another great pass defense.\nThe Cougars allowed 6.8 yards per pass last year against a schedule of good passing teams\nthat combined to average 7.3 ypp on offense for the season. With three-fourths of the\nsecondary returning, including 2 possible All-Pac 10 caliber players, the Cougars will be\nconsiderably tougher to throw on this year. Last week, veteran Idaho quarterback John\nWelsh, who averaged 7.9 ypp in 2000, was held to 66 passing yards in 26 attempts for 2.5\nypp! I doubt that Washington State can be that good again this week against the pass, but\nI certainly don't see Dinwiddle doing much damage with his arm. The Broncos do have a\ngood rushing attack and they will probably pick up enough yards on the ground to score\nsome points. They just won't score enough to keep up with what their inexperienced\ndefense gives up. I am aware of Boise State's 10 straight spread wins at home, but all of\nthose wins were with Hendricks at quarterback and with Dirk Koetter as head coach,\nneither of which is with the team anymore. Also, most of those big victories at home came\nagainst lowly Big West teams. I am not concerned at all with Boise's home field advantage\nas my ratings favor Washington State by 10 points and they also qualify in a solid 161-95-\n4 ATS early season indicator that pegged them as a play last week also.\n\n2 Star Selection\nOREGON (-17.0) 24 Utah 17\nThe Ducks are an overrated team and I have no problem going against them with an always\ncompetitive Utes squad that is 22-11 ATS as a road underdog under coach McBride,\nincluding 13-1 ATS recently as a road dog of 2 points or more. Oregon, meanwhile, is now\njust 8-19 ATS when favored by 9 points or more. I maintained most of last season that\nquarterback Joey Harrington was overrated and I stated that again last week. The\nHarrington for Heisman campaign is a joke. Harrington completed only 53% of his passes\nlast season for 7.3 yards per pass while tossing 14 interceptions. While those numbers\nare certainly better than average (6.9 ypp is the national average), they are hardly\nworthy of such praise. Last week, Harrington completed just 22 of 48 passes for only 5.8\nypp while throwing 2 interceptions. Utah loses all 4 starting defensive backs from a unit\nthat allowed just 6.1 ypp last season, but McBride has always fielded very good\nsecondaries. In fact, Utah has not allowed more than 52% completions in any of the last 7\nseasons, including a few years when the secondary lost 3 or more starters. Last week,\nUtah allowed just 5.4 yards per pass and intercepted 3 passes in their win over Utah\nState, indicating that the Utes will be better than average defending the pass once\nagain. Utah is also good defending the run, as they allowed just 3.2 ypr last season and\nshould be just as good this year in that department. Oregon's RB Maurice Morris also gets\nplenty of press, but he averaged a sub-par 4.2 ypr last season (the national average is\n4.5 for running backs) and had just 18 yards on 15 rushes last week. Don't expect too\nmany points from the Ducks in this one. Oregon also has some trouble spots on defense\nthat Utah can take advantage of. While the Ducks have one of the nation's best\nsecondaries, the front 7 is vulnerable. Only 1 of Oregon's defensive front 7 is a\nreturning starter and the loss of players that accounted for 74% of the Ducks' tackles\nfor loss are now gone. Teams that lose such a high percentage of impact players on\ndefense usually struggle early in the season and Oregon qualifies in a negative 36-71 ATS\nindicator based on that high percentage of sacks and tackles for loss from players that\nhave graduated. Wisconsin ran for a healthy 4.9 ypr against the rebuilt Ducks' front 7\nlast week and McBride will be smart enough to attack the Ducks on the ground with an\noffensive line that did not lose a starter to graduation (although G Ta'amu is serving a\nsuspension). Utah ran behind that experienced line for 213 yards last week and will do a\nsolid job rushing again this week. I really don't expect much from the Utes' pass attack\nagainst a very good Oregon secondary, but I am fond of defensive solid underdogs that can\nrun the ball and you should be too.\n<p><b>\nPass if Utah becomes an underdog of less than 14 points.</b>\n\n\n2 Star Selection\nRICE (-9.0) 31 Duke 13\nThe loss of starting quarterback Jeremy Hurd may actually have been a blessing for the\nOwls as it allowed sophomore Kyle Herm to lead the offense in last week's 21-14 win at\nHouston. Herm had limited action in his freshman campaign and proved to be a good running\nquarterback for the option, gaining 136 rushing yards at 6.5 yards per rush. Herm ran for\n108 yards on 18 carries last week, solidifying his spot as the starter. Herm appears to\nbe the best fit to run the ball with, but he has had problems throwing it and managed\nonly 16 yards in 8 passes last week. That should not be a problem when Rice faces teams\nthat can't defend the run very well. Last week, the Owls ran for 354 yards at a healthy\n5.1 ypr behind an offensive line with returning starters at every position. Running for\nthat many yards on grass against a Houston defense that allowed only 3.4 ypr last year is\na good indication of things to come. Option teams usually perform better when playing on\nthe same surface that they play on at home since a different surface can affect the\ntiming of their offense. Rice plays on artificial turf at home and they are 21-10-1 ATS\non the fake stuff the last few years while going just 10-18 ATS on natural grass under\ncoach Hatfield. Now, Rice comes home to face a Duke team that surrendered 4.6 ypr last \nseason and gave up 200 rushing yards at 5.3 ypr to Florida State last week. While the\nBlue Devils should be better defending the run this year, I still rate them as worse than\naverage and don't see them handling the option very well. A horrible Wake Forest offense\nran some option against Duke last season and the Blue Devils surrendered 244 rushing\nyards at 5.1 ypr and 28 points to a Demon Deacons squad that averaged only 3.6 ypr and 16\npoints for the season. I forecast Rice to rack up over 350 rushing yards again today.\nDuke's offense will be unable to keep up against a solid Rice defense that is better than\naverage against both the run and the pass with 8 returning starters coming back to a unit\nthat was solid a year ago (Rice allowed 29 points per game but faced great offensive\nteams Michigan, Oklahoma, San Jose State, Fresno State, TCU and UTEP last season). Duke's\noffense should be better than last year's unit that averaged just 14 points but they\nstill look pretty bad this year even with 8 returning starters. Rice qualifies in a 55-17-\n1 ATS statistical indicator I see no reason not to ride that angle for a Best Bet since\nthat indicator plays on good rushing teams facing teams that statistically don't stop the\nrun well. That is certainly the case here.\n\nStrong Opinion\nIndiana 28 NO CAROLINA ST. (-6.5) 27\nIn last year's opener, the Hoosiers led the Wolfpack by 12 points with 5 minutes left but\ncould not hold the lead and lost by 3 points, one of 4 losses by 7 points or less during\ntheir disappointing 3-8 season. Indiana had no trouble scoring (31 ppg), they just\ncouldn't stop teams from scoring more (39 ppg allowed). The big news in Bloomington is\nthe switch of exciting 3 year starting quarterback Antwaan Randle El to wide receiver.\nRandle El ran for 1270 yards at 5.8 ypr but had a bad year throwing the football,\ncompleting only 48% of his passes. Junior Tommy Jones steps in to play quarterback and\nshould do at least as well throwing the football. You might think that the running stats\nwould take a hit with the loss of Randle El's 1270 yards and 5.8 ypr, but a great\noffensive line returns intact along with super running back Levron Williams (7.0 ypr in 2\nseasons) and the running backs as a unit averaged 5.8 ypr last season. Overall, Indiana\nshould once again be a good offensive team. NC State put up pretty good offensive numbers\nthemselves last season with freshman quarterback Phillip Rivers and receiver Koren\nRobinson doing most of the damage for a unit that averaged 32 points per contest.\nRobinson was the #1 draft choice of the Seattle Seahawks and he will be sorely missed\nafter hauling in 1218 yards and scoring 14 touchdowns. Also missed will be offensive\ncoordinator Norm Chow, who transformed the offense in his one year here in Raleigh. While\nRivers should be better in his sophomore season, I really don't see him having much\nbetter numbers without Robinson to throw to. Rivers was also aided last year with a\nschedule of opponents that couldn't stop the pass. Rivers averaged a solid 7.0 yards per\npass, but NC State's opponents combined to allow an average of 7.6 yards per pass, so the\nWolfpack actually had a below average pass attack last year. The only team that NC State\nfaced that was better than average defending the pass was Florida State and Rivers threw\nfor only 5.5 ypp in that game. Indiana allowed a horrid 8.0 yards per pass last season\nafter losing 2 starters in the pre-season, but they will much improved in that area,\nalthough still below average, this season with 3 of 4 starters returning and an upgrade\nin talent. The Hoosiers will certainly improve upon the 4.7 ypr that they allowed last\nseason and I expect NC State to mount an average rush attack in this game after running\nfor only 3.3 ypr last season as they appear improved along the offensive line. While NC\nState will have a decent offensive performance in this game, I will call for the Hoosiers\nto control matters with their offense against a solid Wolfpack defense that will improve\non the mediocre 5.1 yards per play that they surrendered last season. NC State's strength\non that unit was defending the pass, but they were susceptible to good running teams last\nyear and allowed Indiana to rush for 236 yards at 5.4 ypr in last year's meeting.\nIndiana's 16 returning starters have been focused on this revenge game all summer long\nand teams with that many returning starters usually get their revenge in their opener. In\nfact, Indiana qualifies in a 40-15 ATS game 1 revenge situation and they are capable of\nthe upset tonight.\n\nStrong Opinion\nTEXAS (-22.0) 35 North Carolina 7\nCarolina scored on a 77 yard run early in the first quarter at Maryland last week but\ngained just 276 total yards for the entire game in their 7-23 loss. The lack of offense\nand a -3 in turnover margin masked another very good defensive effort by the Tarheels'\ndefense, who allowed just 246 total yards to the Terps after yielding just 286 yards to\nOklahoma the week before. The Tarheels have out-gained their two opponents by an average\nof 283 yards to 267 yards per game, but are -7 in turnover margin. I doubt that Carolina\nwill even come close to out-gaining the Longhorns in this game and I see them getting\nbeaten soundly even if turnovers are not a problem for them (they were also -12 in\nturnover margin last season). Texas didn't look too good on offense in last week's 41-7\nwin over New Mexico State, averaging just 4.8 yards per play, but the Longhorns have\nplenty of firepower and I expect a better performance from that unit today. Texas\naveraged in impressive 5.9 yards per play on offense last season and return 9 of 11\nstarters from that side of the ball and will be even better this year with Chris Simms as\nthe undisputed starting quarterback. North Carolina does have a very good defense and\nthey are especially tough to run on, but I don't see them keeping Texas from moving the\nball through the air. The Tarheels actually have an above average secondary, but they\nallowed good passing teams Florida State, Georgia Tech, Clemson and Pittsburgh to average\n10.1 yards per pass against them last season. Simms averaged 8.7 yards per pass last\nseason and should have a very effective outing today. North Carolina, meanwhile, will\nhave few chances to score against a Texas defense that rates among the best in the\nnation. The 'Horns allowed just 2.7 ypr and 5.6 ypp last season and return 8 starters to\nthe defense and should be even better this season. North Carolina has a poor rushing\nattack and throwing into the Texas secondary will only lead to trouble as Texas picked\noff 18 passes last year and returned 5 of them for touchdowns. Texas has the best\nsecondary in the nation and Ronald Curry has not proven capable of consistently beating\nany team through the air. Texas has covered 6 straight home games when not laying 27\npoints or more and this looks like a game that will add to that tally.\n\nStrong Opinion\nGeorgia Tech (-24.0) 38 NAVY 7\nGeorgia Tech has whipped the Middies the last two years, 40-13 at home last year and 49-\n14 here in Annapolis in '99. Navy's once great rush attack (284 yards per game at 5.2 ypr\nfrom '96 through '99) has disappeared. Last year, the Midshipmen averaged just 178 yards\nat 3.6 ypr and last week managed only 49 yards on 31 rushes in their 19 point loss at\nTemple. The pre-season injury to great running quarterback Brian Madden hurt them last\nyear and Madden is expected to be out again this week due to a suspension. Starting\nquarterback Ed Malinowski is a better throwing quarterback than Madden, but Malinowski\naveraged just 2.0 ypr last year and had just 3 yards rushing last week. By contrast,\nMadden ran for 961 yards at 5.3 ypr in just 5 starts in '99. Without Madden in the lineup\nand with 4 new starters on the offensive line, I don't see Navy having any success\nrunning against a very good Georgia Tech front 7 that allowed just 2.7 ypr last year and\nheld the Syracuse option to just 59 yards rushing on 26 carries two weeks ago (and\nallowed just 70 yards on 34 rushes last week to the Citadel). Malinowski, while better\nthan Manning throwing the ball, is still a below average passer and I just don't think\nhe'll be able to beat a sound Yellow Jackets' secondary through the air. Georgia Tech has\nheld both of their opponents to 7 points and that's about all Navy will muster today. The\nYellow Jackets' offense struggled a bit in their first game without former offensive\ncoordinator Ralph Friedgen, but that was against a very good Syracuse defense. The\noffense looked great in scoring 28 first half points last week and quarterback George\nGodsey is now averaging 10.6 yards per pass with zero interceptions in two games and\nought to have another big day throwing into a poor Navy secondary that surrendered 8.8\nyards per pass last season. The Middies are stronger in the secondary this year, but I\nstill rate them considerably below average and they will have no answer for Godsey. Navy\ndoes stop the run pretty well and Georgia Tech still has not established a good rushing\nattack (3.0 ypr in 2 games), but they will convert on most of their 3rd down passes and\nmove the ball even without the benefit of a good rush attack. Navy is just 5-18 ATS as a\nhome underdog of more than 3 points over the years and Georgia Tech should administer\nanother beating today even if they are peeking ahead towards next week's showdown with\nFlorida State.\n\nStrong Opinion\nFresno St. 27 WISCONSIN (-4.0) 24\nFresno State is for real. A narrow win at Colorado and a 44-24 whipping of highly ranked\nOregon State have the Bulldogs believing in themselves and I'll call for another upset\nwin this week here in Madison. The Bulldogs are led by future NFL quarterback David Carr,\nwho has thrown for 538 yards in two games at 7.7 yards per pass with zero interceptions\nagainst two very good defensive backfields. Wisconsin has a good secondary as well and\nthey held Oregon's Joey Harrington to just 5.8 yards per pass last week. However, Carr is\nbetter than Harrington and should put up pretty decent numbers again this week after\nbeating one of the nation's best secondaries for 340 yards on just 34 tosses last week.\nWhile Carr gets the press, it is the Bulldogs' defense that is the key here. Fresno State\nhas limited two explosive offensive teams to just 368 total yards per game at 1.5 ypr and\n7.4 ypp. Leading Heisman Trophy candidate Ken Simonton from Oregon State had just 42\nyards on 15 carries against the Bulldogs last week and Fresno is quite capable of\nshutting down Wisconsin's rush attack as well. The 7.4 yards per pass that Fresno has\nallowed is also very good when you consider that Colorado quarterback Ochs and Oregon\nState quarterback Smith will both average around 8 yards per pass this season. Fresno\nreturned all 4 starters to a secondary that yielded just 6.2 yards per pass last year, so\nthere is no question that the 'Dogs can stop the pass. Wisconsin's Jim Sorgi has once\nagain done a good job filling in for injured starter Brooks Bollinger and Sorgi is\ncapable of putting up decent numbers in this game. However, the Badgers are a running\nteam and Fresno will not make it easy to move the ball on the ground. Fresno's offense\nwon't have much of a rush attack either, but Carr should move the ball through the air\nwell enough to get the Bulldogs into the end zone a few times. Fresno has not been a\ngreat road team in recent years (5-17-1 ATS when not getting at least 12 points, but 1-0\nthis year), but the Bulldogs qualify in a 161-95-4 ATS early season indicator that has\nworked well for me over the years.\n\nStrong Opinion\nMIDDLE TENN (-13.5) 41 Troy State 21\nMiddle Tennessee racked up 300 rushing yards and 308 passing yards in their 37-28 win at\nVanderbilt last week and they should rack up more huge chunks of yardage this week if\nthey can avoid the letdown after their big win over and SEC school. The Blue Raiders were\njust as potent last year on offense and they should have good success against a Troy\nState defense that was very good by Division 1AA standards, but will be below par in\nDivision 1A. The Troy State offense will be well below average in Division 1A ball and\nthey don't appear capable of taking full advantage of a soft Middle Tennessee defense\nthat allowed Vanderbilt to roll up 477 yards last week. MTS qualifies in a 55-17-1 ATS\nearly season momentum situation, so I will consider them a strong opinion in this game\nbased on that angle.\n\nStrong Opinion\nTCU (-12.0) 13 SMU 7\nThe Mustangs lost 6-36 at Louisiana Tech last week, but that was a VERY misleading final\nand gives us plenty of line value on them this week. SMU's solid defense held Tech to\njust 245 total yards, but two defensive touchdowns by the Bulldogs and a third TD set up\nby another Mustangs' miscue led to 21 gift points. While the defense was as good as\nexpected, the offense was horrible. SMU was expected to be better offensively this year\nwith 8 returning starters on that side of the ball, but the Mustangs averaged a pathetic\n3.3 yards per play against a soft Louisiana Tech defense. I do expect a better offensive\nperformance from SMU this year, but they will not be good enough to score much against a\nTCU defense that is playing better than last year's outstanding unit. TCU opened the\nseason by limiting a powerful Nebraska offense to just 21 points on 310 total yards and\nthen shut down North Texas last week, holding them to just 129 yards and a lone field\ngoal. TCU's offense has gone from great to poor without star RB Tomlinson and the loss of\n4 starting offensive lineman. The Horned Frogs were held to 186 total yards by Nebraska,\nwhich certainly can be forgiven. But, TCU could tally just 198 total yards against a\nNorth Texas defense that is not as good as SMU's stop unit. This ought to be a very low\nscoring game and the points look worth taking.\n\nStrong Opinion\nGEORGIA 24 South Carolina (-2.0) 19\nLast year, I pegged South Carolina to upset Georgia as a 10 point home underdog a week\nafter the Gamecocks broke a 21 game losing streak. A 21-10 win ensued and I rode the Lou\nHoltz' team to a number of Best Bet wins as they remained underrated all season long.\nLast week, I used South Carolina as a 2-Star Best Bet and 2 missed extra points (one\nkicking and one two-pointer attempt) and a late Boise touchdown cost me the win in that\ngame. Now, it looks like all the value in taking South Carolina has ended as they went\nfrom an opening 3 point underdog in this game to a 2 point favorite despite numerous\ninjuries. My ratings show that Georgia by 3 is exactly what the line should be and I'm\nfavoring Georgia to win by even more due to those Carolina injuries and a 102-42-4 ATS\nhome momentum situation favoring Georgia in this game. These two teams are eerily similar\non both sides of the ball, with South Carolina being a better running team and Georgia\nperhaps a better passing team with young David Greene completing 21 of 29 passes for 285 \nyards in his debut, rewarding coach Richt's choice to start him over the more experienced\nCory Phillips. Defensively, both teams are very good defending the run and extremely good\nagainst the pass. South Carolina is no longer a pointspread value, so I will side with a\nvengeful Georgia team in a good situation. Also, the Gamecocks were 0-3 straight up on\nthe road against good teams last year, losing at Alabama, Florida, and Clemson. They also\nbarely beat a weak Kentucky team 20-17 on the road last year. The fact that Bulldogs QB\nGreene is so inexperienced is the only reason I'm not taking Georgia as a Best Bet in\nthis game.\n\nStrong Opinion\nARIZONA ST. (-7.0) 21 San Diego St. 20\nThe Sun Devils' new offense will get a stiff test against a veteran San Diego State\ndefense that held Arizona to just 231 total yards last week. The Aztecs are very good\ndefending both the run and the pass and I expect Arizona State to be just average\noffensively across the board this year, at least until they get comfortable with the new\noffense. San Diego State's offense had the unenviable task of dealing with a dominating\nArizona defense and they could manage just 201 yards and 10 points in their loss to the\nWildcats. San Diego State doesn't have much of a running attack, but quarterback Lon\nSheriff averaged 7.5 yards per pass last year and returns his entire offense with him\nthis year. Sheriff should put up pretty decent numbers against a good, but not great ASU\nsecondary and the running game could contribute for once since the Devils should be just\naverage defending the run. It's tough to know exactly how the Sun Devils will perform in\nnew coach Koettner's offense, but I do know that San Diego State has a great defense and\ntaking points with them looks like a solid play, especially after their disappointing 10-\n23 loss to Arizona in which the Wildcats returned a fumble for a touchdown. San Diego\nState has 20 returning starters and teams with an abundance of veteran starters usually\nbounce back from a sub-par opening game performance, especially in the underdog role.\n\nStrong Opinion\nVIRGINIA TECH (-15.0) 28 Western Mich 10\nThe Hokies are now without their two biggest offensive weapons from a year ago, #1 draft\npick QB Michael Vick and future NFL draft pick RB Lee Suggs, who was injured last week\nand is out for the season. Hokies fans need not panic. Grant Noel did an excellent job in\nhis first start last week, completing 16 of 20 passes for 267 yards and 3 touchdowns and\nappears to be a lot more accurate than Vick was (54% last year). I also don't think the\nrushing attack will drop off much with Keith Burnell getting the load of the work.\nBurnell is just as fast as Suggs and has averaged nearly 7 yards per carry in his 27\ncarries the last two seasons, including 9 for 71 yards last week. Virginia Tech averaged\n5.2 yards per rush last year with Vick and Suggs as their top two rushers. Aside from\nthose two, the rest of the Hokies' backs averaged 4.85 ypr, so the rush attack will still\nbe good this season. Western Michigan will put up some resistance as they are a very good\ndefensive team. The Broncos allowed just 2.7 ypr and 6.2 ypp last year and performed well\noutside of the MAC, limiting Wisconsin and Iowa to an average of 20 points (they also\nallowed just 14 points to Toledo). Western Michigan will be just as tough defensively\nthis year, although not quite as good against the rush with the loss of two outstanding\nlinebackers (the secondary will be better though). My ratings still forecast 28 points\nfor the Hokies as they should run for over 4 yards per rush and throw for close to 7\nyards per pass. Western Michigan's offense returns QB Jeff Welsh (7.2 ypp last year), but\nonly 4 other offensive starters return and Welsh will not have a running attack to\nsupport him in this game. Virginia Tech also has one of the nation's top secondaries and\nI don't see Welsh doing too much damage in the air. The line has been adjusted down due\nto the injury to Suggs, but I don't see that as being too much of a factor so I will use\nthe line value and lean with the Hokies, who are 18-8-1 ATS at home when not laying 30\npoints or more. The Under is worth a look here.\n\nStrong Opinion\nTennessee (-13.0) 20 ARKANSAS 7\nThis is a lot of points to be giving in what should be a game dominated by the defenses.\nThe Vols looked impressive on the scoreboard in last week's 33-9 win over Syracuse but\nTennessee's offense struggled against a solid Syracuse stop unit. The Volunteers ran the\nball better than I expected last week (197 yards at 5.1 ypr), but they had trouble\nthrowing into a good Syracuse secondary and Clausen completed just over 50% of his passes\nfor an average of just 5.0 yards per pass. I expect Tennessee to be able to run the ball\npretty well again this week against a mediocre Arkansas defensive front that allowed UNLV\nto rush for 258 yards at 4.8 ypr. However, Clausen's difficulties should continue as well\nagainst a Hogs secondary that is among the very best in the nation. Arkansas allowed just\n6.0 yards per pass last season against good competition and return all 4 starters to\ntheir secondary. Last week the Razorbacks limited UNLV's star quarterback Jason Thomas to\n4 of 16 passing for just 40 aerial yards with 3 interceptions (Thomas averaged 8.8 ypp\nlast year and over 11 yards per pass against Arkansas in Vegas Bowl last December).\nTennessee will not be able to move the ball consistently without a good pass attack and I\ndon't see them scoring much more than 20 points, if that. Tennessee is also very good\ndefensively and the defend both the run and pass equally well. Stopping the run is the\nkey for the Vols in this game since Arkansas only has one quarterback that can throw and\nhe is unable to play. Last year, Robbie Hampton got most of the playing time despite some\nnagging injuries and he averaged just 5.8 yards per pass. The other quarterbacks combined\nto average a pathetic 4.0 yards per pass in 91 attempts while tossing 7 interceptions.\nLast week, with Hampton not available, Zak Clark and Ryan Sorahan combined to go 10 of 32\npassing for just 89 yards (2.8 ypp). Without a pass attack, it will be up to talented\nbacks Talley and Cobbs to carry the offense. However, Tennessee allowed just 2.8 ypr last\nseason and appears to be even better this year, holding a pretty good Syracuse rush\nattack to just 1.8 yards per rush last week. The Arkansas backs combined for just 50\nyards on 22 carries last week against a UNLV defense that stacked the line to stop the\nrun, knowing that Arkansas could not beat them in the air. Tennessee can do the same\nthing today and the Razorbacks will have trouble scoring. I'd stay away from the side in\nthis one, but the UNDER looks appealing.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nYour subsciption to this package ends on 31-Jan-02.\n"

The official creditors' committee supports the plan.\n\"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=\nric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=\ntioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=\nicity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=\nthout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,\" said Robert D. Glynn,=\n Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=\nesident of PG&E Corporation.  \"And, the plan will enable us to provide long=\n-term growth prospects to shareholders.\" =20\nThe plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =\ninto two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=\nher. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =\nand operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=\nm.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=\nssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=\nart of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=\nnd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.\nThe electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=\nons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=\nhe ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=\nc Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=\nstructures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=\natisfy creditor claims.=20\nUnder the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=\nbination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=\nitors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=\najority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=\neive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=\ntive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=\nt of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=\ned claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=\nsh and 40 percent in notes.\n =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =\nCorporation will be organized as follows:=20\n\n?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=\nion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=\nts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=\nf the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=\n0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=\nll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20\n\n?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=\niness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=\nc generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=\ny under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20\n\nThe new electric generation business will be a California company establish=\ned to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=\nssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=\ns, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=\n00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =\nwith all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=\neping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=\nss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=\npany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20\nThe new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=\nshed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=\ntility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=\n lines and cables.\nThe new gas transmission business will be a California company established =\nto own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=\ny the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=\ns storage facilities. =20\nFollowing the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=\nll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=\nncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=\nory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =\nfor the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=\ne provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=\nrisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =\nPower Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=\ns transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20\nGlynn said, \"This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=\nable and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=\n company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =\ngenerating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=\n to pay creditors.\"\nThe company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=\nf its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=\n and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=\nially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=\nnization.=20\n\"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=\n do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,\" said =\nGlynn.  \"We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=\nhe people who know how to run them best.\"\nIn addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=\nstomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=\nte.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=\n for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=\nric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=\nbility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=\nesources.\nThe Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =\nbe confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20\nPaul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=\nrs, said \"This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=\nesolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=\null support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=\nr 11 process.\"=20\n\"With this plan filed,\" said Glynn, \"we are now focused on bringing the Cha=\npter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=\northiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=\ns' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders.\"\n- 30 -\n\nAt 10:00 AM Pacific Time today, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electr=\nic Company will discuss the plan of reorganization on a conference call for=\n members of the media.  The dial-in number for the call is 1 (877) 691-0877=\n or 1 (800) 521-5461.

The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the \t\tNorthwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central \t\tpools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at \t\tSocal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio \t\t\tPuerco \tand Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.\n\n\t\tI had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and \t\t\tMojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to \t\t\t938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.\n\nEVE:\t\tHad to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin \t\t\tcontract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on \t\tcycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if \t\tthey did schedule on the Evening.\n\nNON-GRID:\tConfirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying \t\tto fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for \t\t\tthe South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through \t\t\t22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the \t\tsystem didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.\n\nIf you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.\n\nBert"

I understand that by sometime early next \nweek the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron \nvault.  \n\nHere is what we now need to do:\n\n1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it \ninto three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately \n1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.\n\n2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital \nsplit?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.\n\n3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision \n(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel \nshares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will \ngo to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would \nhappen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about \n15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).\n\n4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need \nto put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we \nwill bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).\n\n5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to \nestablish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate \nto unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to \nfigure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for \nevery small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these \n1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets \n(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 \nmonths time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  \n\nRobert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer \nshares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M \"unrestriction\" with BONY and Skadden. \n\n\nRegards,  Bruce\n713-853-0950 \n\n\n\n\n\n"

Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  \nAs result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) \n2.\tThe employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.     \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tClark, Mary  \nSent:\tSunday, November 25, 2001 6:49 PM\nTo:\tJones, Robert W.- HR Exec\nCc:\tOxley, David; Cash, Michelle; James, Terrie; Denne, Karen; Johnson, Rick\nSubject:\tA few questions about the scripts\n\nI have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me\n\n1.

His name is Bil=\nl Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp=\nringfield, Missouri.  In his comments he stated that his utility was \"whole=\nheartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO\" and then went =\non to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss=\nues if FERC doesn't stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs.\n=20\nHe stated that \"flexible\" standardization would not work and that the FERC =\nshould put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti=\nlity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d=\nifferent, then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a=\nn exemption, not the other way around. =20\n=20\nI'm thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ=\nee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks to testify in the f=\nuture. IF you are able to get transcripts from RTO week, it might also be w=\north it to review his comments and pass them on as appropriate. =20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n\n-----Original Message-----=20\nFrom: Rodriquez, Andy=20\nSent: Thu 10/18/2001 4:46 PM=20\nTo: Black, Tamara Jae; '/o=3DENRON/ou=3DNA/cn=3DRecipients/cn=3Dnotesaddr/c=\nn=3Da478079f-55e1f3b0-862566fa-612229'; Abler, William; Aggarwal, Anubhav; =\nAllen, Diana; Arora, Harry; Bailey, Debra; Ballato, Russell; Ballinger, Ted=\n; Baughman Jr., Don; Benchluch, Moises; Benjelloun, Hicham; Benson, Robert;=\n Bentley, Corry; Blaine, Jay; Bolt, Laurel; Broderick, Paul J.; Broussard, =\nRichard; Burnett, Lisa; Campbell, Larry F.; Capasso, Joe; Carson, Mike; Che=\nn, Alan; Choate, Jason; Cline, Kevin; Collins, Dustin; Comeaux, Keith; Coul=\nter, Kayne; Davis, Mark Dana; Day, Smith L.; Dean, Clint; Decook, Todd; Eme=\nsih, Gerald; Errigo, Joe; Forney, John M.; Freije, William; Garcia, Miguel =\nL.; Gilbert, Gerald; Gilbert-smith, Doug; Giron, Gustavo; Greer, Andrew; Gu=\naly, Jaime; Guerra, Claudia; Gulmeden, Utku; Gupta, Gautam; Ha, Amie; Hanse=\n, Patrick; Hernandez, Juan; Imai, Rika; Ingram, David; Jenkins IV, Daniel; =\nKaniss, Jason; King, Jeff; Kinser, John; Larkworthy, Carrie; Laurent, Dean;=\n Laverell, Justin; Lenartowicz, Chris; Lorenz, Matt; Lotz, Gretchen; Lowell=\n, Thomas; Mack, Iris; Mahajan, Ashish; Makkai, Peter; Marquez, Mauricio; Ma=\nskell, David; May, Tom; McElreath, Alexander; Miller, Jeffrey; Oh, Seung-Ta=\nek; Olinde Jr., Steve; Pace, Andy; Padron, Juan; Pan, Steve; Philip, Willis=\n; Podurgiel, Laura; Poppa, John D.; Presto, Kevin M.; Quenet, Joe; Rawal, P=\nunit; Rogers, Benjamin; Rust, Bill; Ryan, David; Saibi, Eric; Schiavone, Pa=\nul; Schneider, Bryce; Seely, Michael; Serio, Erik; Shoemake, Lisa; Simpson,=\n Erik; Stalford, Robert; Stepenovitch, Joe; Sturm, Fletcher J.; Symms, Mark=\n; Tamma, Ramanarao; Thomas, Paul D.; Trejo, Reese; Valdes, Maria; Vernon, C=\nlayton; Wang, Steve; Williams, Ryan; Willis, Cory; Zipperer, Mike; Baughman=\n, Edward D.; Clynes, Terri; Dalton III, Oscar; Kelly, Mike E.; Sewell, Doug=\n; Valderrama, Larry; Walton, Steve; Roan, Michael; Perrino, Dave; Maurer, L=\nuiz; Hueter, Barbara A.; Landwehr, Susan M.; Hoatson, Tom; Novosel, Sarah; =\nNicolay, Christi L.; Yeung, Charles=20\nCc:=20\nSubject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel\n\n\nRTO Week\n\n=20\n\nDay 4 - October 18, 2001\n\nAfternoon Session\n\n=20\n\nStandardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20\n\nPanelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =\nGroup; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=\nistiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=\nral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=\nota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=\nmpany.\n\n=20\n\n\nGeneral Observations\n\n\n=20\n\nThe Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=\nte in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=\nhe commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=\n all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =\nmuch discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=\nd very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=\nrward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=\nward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=\nt some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=\no be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=\niscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=\n reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=\nble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=\nanizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20\n\n=20\n\n\nFERC Deliverables\n\n\nA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=\neded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =\nfelt was critical. =20\n\nThe first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=\nists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=\ny FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=\nge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\n\nThe next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=\nd on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=\nor one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=\nndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=\nfollowed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=\nnt situation.\n\nThe commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=\nt the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=\n throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =\na Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you=\n need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =\nwanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=\no say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=\n little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=\nt in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=\nhe need for cautious investigation. =20\n\nOne item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=\nheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=\ne \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=\nstions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=\nos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =\na course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=\nction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =\nquestions:\n\n\n?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=\nr, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=\ns nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=\n be others that must be accommodated?\n\n\n?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=\nedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=\ning from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=\nllowed)?=20\n\n\n?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =\nservices appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=\n to be addressed?\n\n\n?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=\nior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=\nre those contracts?  Are there other solutions?\n\n\n?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=\n Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=\n, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=\ndules), or will they be required at all?\n\n\n?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =\nin standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=\n services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=\nncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?\n\n\n?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =\n Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=\nss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=\nly unwieldy?\n\n\n?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=\nd into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =\nnon-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=\nreat each NJE as a separate entity?\n\n\nHopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=\nl questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =\nto move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=\n, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=\nake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=\nal hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =\nabout moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =\nto move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n\nNow for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=\nred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=\non of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=\n said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =\nbelieve that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=\nhat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=\nion by the Northwest interests was false.\n\n\nNERC and GISB\n\n\nA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=\ntting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a bea=\nuty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=\nl short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=\ninually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=\nly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=\nSB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and=\n did not focus on its history.\n\nBrownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=\nsking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=\n they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=\nble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=\ng of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=\nt, Brownell.\n\nMennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=\nan.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=\ned \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =\nlikely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulti=\nng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=\n in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=\n the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n\nThere was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=\n, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =\ntalk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n\nThe arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=\nged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=\nrship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=\nomewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=\n say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771=20\n\n"

These reports were the result of a \nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff \n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of \ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed \nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller \n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no \nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically \nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, \nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the \nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement \nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by \nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other \ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to \nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of \ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff \nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of \ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro \nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply \nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and \nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions \npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports \nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well \nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such \nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that \ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that \neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  \nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could \nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics \nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a \nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the \nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a \ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the \ncommodity and services.  \n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, \ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission \nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such, \nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service \nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff \nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information \navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated \nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack \nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants \nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  \n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an \n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from \n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  \nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with \nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were \nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and \nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even \nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, \n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The \ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are \nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose \nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission \nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open \nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to \nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission \nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, \nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market \nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an \ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In \naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased \nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one \ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for \nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe \nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction \nincreased in the Midwest.  \n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information \nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for \nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission \naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and \nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and \ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, \nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs \nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market \ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully \nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, \neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that \nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed \nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the \nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching \nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, \nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided \nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper \nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all \nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and \nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO \nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security \ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region \nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The \nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  \nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit \nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is \nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of \nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially \non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas \nof non-compliance.  \n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, \nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow \ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information \ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under \nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a \nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption \nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could \nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the \nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, \nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits \nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have \nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have \nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide \nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the \nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the \nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\" \nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory \nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  \nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, \nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has \nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the \neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs \nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due \nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, \ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and \nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the \ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development \nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and \nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted \nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the \nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have \nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to \nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform \ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant \nplants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.\n\nStaff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this \nsummer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than \nthe use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were \nradically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better \nprepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased \ngeneration capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  \n\nSE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to \nextensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)\n\nThe SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to \ndiscern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE \n(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence \nin the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be \njustified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence \ndiscourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes \nthat the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how \ntransmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns \nthat the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation \nfound numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In \naddition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff \nthinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  \nStaff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of \njurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access \ninformation.\n\nThe Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack \nof adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In \naddition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission \ncapacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to \ninterconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied \nSkygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the \nconstruction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  \nStaff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting \nself-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.\n\nATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a \nstandardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without \ndirection from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication \nare needed.\n\nThe SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises \nthe issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive \noperation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by \nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC \ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do \nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs \nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In \naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  \nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated \nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the \nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, \ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same \ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision \nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a \n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission \nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law \nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of \ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong \nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In \naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists \na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the \ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park \npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the \ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including \nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange \ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to \nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an \nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not \ndisplayed in error.  It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"  ((FRCC \nweb site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine \ncompetition.\n\nThe reports are attached below.\n\n - southeast.pdf\n - midwest.pdf\n\n"

Therefore, Nicor Gas Company \nis the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the \nattorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name \"Northern Illinois \nGas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company\" eversince the name change happened. He \nsaid they had been using both names \"contractually\" and interchangeably even \nthough it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.\n\nI'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks \nlike thats going to happen:\nThe main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the \ntrades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we \ncould have a Tradename set up as \"Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor \nGas Company\" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.\n\nNicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further \nclarifications in this matter.\n\nAdnan Patel\nGlobal Counterparty\nx58335\n\n\n\nFrom: Tana Jones@ECT on 08/17/2000 03:47 PM\nTo: Stacy E Dickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Adnan \nPatel/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company\n\nThere appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading \nwith these entities.\n\nWe have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company \nd/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not \nset up this way it need to be.\n\nPhysical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.\n\nThere is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only \ntrading being done with this entity is online gas trading.\n\nThe issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under \nboth Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will \nresolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical \ngas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.\n\nWhen we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we \nwant to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the \ncorrect Password Application to match out intended trading partners.\n\nSorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.\n\n\n"

However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.\n\nIn addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  \n\nThanks,\nStacey\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBelden, Tim  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 09, 2002 10:26 AM\nTo:\tPostlethwaite, John; Reeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Miller, Don (Asset Mktg); Wax, Brandon\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara; Presto, Kevin M.\nSubject:\tRE: Dec and Jan liquidations\n\nYesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in \"Schedule\" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.\n\nI don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it \"right\" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.\n\nRegards,\nTim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPostlethwaite, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 08, 2002 1:10 PM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Belden, Tim\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara\nSubject:\tDec and Jan liquidations\n\nIt has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.\n\nWhat I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tScholtes, Diana  \nSent:\tThursday, January 03, 2002 8:43 AM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie\nCc:\tGilbert, Scotty; Postlethwaite, John; Belden, Tim\nSubject:\tJanuary Settlements\n\nLeslie,\n\nI'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  \n\nI also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  \n\nIf there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.\n\nDiana Scholtes\nWest Desk \n503-464-3807\n"

I saw Miguel Vasquez lately and I heard from him that you moved back to trading.  Since I left Enron, I've done Telecom banking for a year in Asia with Lehman.   In that group, I've done a lot of valuation and financial analyses.   Deal flow suffered in the telecom industry with the downturn in market conditions.  On my second year at Lehman, I seized the opportunity to do coverage banking, i.e. winning clients in the Philippines and Taiwan.  With this step, I was fortunate to lead an M&A deal in the consumer goods sector.  It also gave me exposure in energy and financial institutions.   Thanks to my Enron background, I actually showed my value added to Lehman in energy.\n \nIt pays to be a generalist in times like this.  The layoffs in banking has been severe.   I have survived so far a big reduction among people of my level.  Good thing I still got a raise this year as many did not.  I don't know about the long term prospects of investment banking but I am thankful that I have a job.  Recently I caught up with my b-school friends in San Francisco and found out that it is equally bad there. Coincidentally, I caught up with a friend of mine who interviewed with Madhur Dayal who know works with Thomas Weisel in San Francisco.\n \nMy wife, Loreli, was able to find a job at the South China Morning Post last July.  So far, we are both enjoying Hong Kong.  Long term though, I believe the U.S. makes sense for both of us.  \n \nHope everything is going well with you.  Please let me know if you just happen to be in Hong Kong.\n \nBest regards,\n \nRoy\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nGet more from the Web. FREE MSN Explorer download : <http://explorer.msn.com>\n"

With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different\nfrom\nthe setoff language.

We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  \n\nThe above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  \n\nYour desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.  \n\n--Sally \n\n"

The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.\n\nThe main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?\n\nPaul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.\n\nThe third special provision, can go either way, your call?\n\nThe fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?\n\nNormally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.\n\nAlso, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.\n\nLet me know later.\n\nChristy\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Barbe, Robin \nSent: Friday, June 14, 2002 1:43 PM\nTo: Finelli, Christina\nSubject: FW: GISB Base Contract - Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.\n\n\nhere's the gisb.  thanks for your help.\n\nrobin\n37177\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Carol_Wilson@oxy.com [mailto:Carol_Wilson@oxy.com]\nSent: Thursday, June 13, 2002 3:24 PM\nTo: Barbe, Robin\nSubject: GISB Base Contract - Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.\n\n\nRobin,\n\nHow are you doing?

The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. \n\nRigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?\n\nStill looking for a copy of the letter from Morris.

We do, however, have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be. More when that develops.\n \n2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.

There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?\n \n2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.

Marc Phillips participated and reported that the \nmeeting was non adversarial and the overall opinion of the Ecoelectrica \nparticipants was that it went well.  EPA stated that it was apparent that \nEcoelectrica had put forth a significant effort in responding to the \ncompliance notice.  Ecoelectrica promised to send additional requested \ninformation to clarify some of the issues identified at the meeting.  EPA \nwill review the information presented at the meeting and follow-up with \nEcoelectrica. There is still a potential for a penalty.\n\nEnron Building Safety - in response to an employee request regarding work \narea safety, Scott Watson reviewed the 12th floor and developed a series of \nrecommendations regarding reconstruction activities.  Scott will work with \nHenry Terech to review other areas for similar issues.  Henry has been very \nreceptive to the to the safety support.\n\n Lagos Emergency Power Plant (9 barges - Nigeria) - Joe Kolb reviewed \nproposal by ERM to gather baseline information and write environmental impact \nassessment (EIA ) and provided comments to Robert Missen.  Also, alerted \nLauren Goldblatt to project.\n\nBest Management Practices - Joe Kolb completed discussions with consultant on \nproposed revisions to pipeline construction environmental BMPs.  Discussed \nstrategy for obtaining \"buy in\" from key people within Enron.    Also, left \nmessage with Alex de Alarez explaining project as it relates to fiber optic \ncables and seeking a meeting.  Consultant is now beginning work on the \nelectric and fiber optic portions.\n\nCuiaba II - Joe Kolb participated in conference call.  Public hearing on \nMonday went very well.  They had given presentations to several concerned \ngroups/agencies prior to the hearing and, as a result, few people showed up \nand there were no controversy or accusatory questions.  Also, folks from the \nRio Gen project were there to observe as they prepare for public \nconsultation/hearing.\n\n\nAnnual Report - Susan Worthen is making minor modifications to the report to \nensure as much information regarding emission reductions, etc. are properly \nconveyed.  Graphics were selected for feature and The Image Center is working \nto  gather the images and photos for the final layout.  The final draft is \nexpected to be available for review by mid to end of next week. \n\nGreenhouse Gas Inventory - Susan Worthen attended a workshop sponsored by the \nPew Center to discusss various strategies and lessons learned by other \ncompanies.  Working with Mary Schoen to identify EPA contact for a demo of \nthe Climate Wise software, which Sunoco highly recommended as did another \ncompany previously did.  A.D. Little was  hired to review the Enron \ngreenhouse gas estimates  and verify them as being calculated accurately \nprior to potential public communication. They have identified systematic \nmathematical and formula (methodology) errors in our international \ninventory.  Ramiro Garcia (Enron contract environmentalist) is assisting with \nthe revision.  ADL will present their findings to us next week.  \n\nENEL, Nicaragua - Mike Fuentes is performing the environmental due \ndiligence.  Don Stevens will perform the cost estimate.\n\n\n"

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily \naverage, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\n[Fairley, David]  \nEach utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the \nappropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities \nmust update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel \nusage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a \nquarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used \nare satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a \nband of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as \noften as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient \ntemps..\n\n2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\n[Fairley, David]  \nYes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, \nand with our internal air permit guys.\n[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to \nus today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are \nlimited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.\n\n\n3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\n[Fairley, David]  \nWe won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we \nmay switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product \ntransaction with the resulting profit split.\n[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible \nfor maintaining fuel oil supplies.\n\n4. We aren't making money on gas, right?\n[Fairley, David]  \nWe make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is \nbasicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way \nwe can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product \ntrade, and those procedures apply.\n\n5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in \nto the picture?\n[Fairley, David]  \nYes, will send separately.\n\n6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \n[Fairley, David]  \nThe Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of \nAsset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been \nmodified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been \ndiscussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their \ncomments/questions incorporated.\n  \n \n\n7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the \nfollowing, in words and/or formulae:\n\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) \nformula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to \nwork on.  \n[Fairley, David]  \nThought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the \nparties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and \nOrig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract \nlanguage is clear enough.\n[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.\n\n Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of \npower)? \n[Fairley, David]  \nThere are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, \n(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for \nimbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their \nNetwork Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource \nitems hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  \nWeather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances \n(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly \ndesk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions \nand obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states \nthat MDEA wears the exposure.\n\n How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is \nset when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties \nparticipate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and \nplanning the day's activities.  \n[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved\n\nSubject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing \nsomething that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have \nless involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them \nto participate and buy in every day.  \n\nTwo bogeys or one (gas and oil)?\n[Fairley, David]  \nOne bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.\n[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.\n\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or \ntwo would be helpful as a reality check.  \n[Fairley, David]  \nThis is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?\n\nWhat costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost \ndefinition being provided separately.\n \n\n\n\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. \n[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. \n\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. \n[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what \nwas mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that \nis a problem. \n\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split \ncosts/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?\n[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily \nand monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing \nresponsibilities to those reports.\n\nIt would be great if I could get one set of answers to these \nquestions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.\n\nThanks,\n\nKay\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The\n            party  refuses  to  give  his  name  or  phone  number.  His  \nreply  has  been  \"If  I  have  to  give  my  name\n            and  number  maybe  I  don't  need  your  confirm\",  then  he  \nhangs  up.  He  has  called  several  times  since\n            I  stopped  you  and  Bob  Bowen  earlier.  I  also  suspect  \nthat  this  same  party  has  been  calling  and  \n            hanging  up  without  answering;  and  calling  from  a  \ndifferent  outside  line  pretending  to  be  someone  else,\n            but  making  the  same  deal  request ,  followed  by  hanging  \nup  when  I  ask  for  his  name  and  phone\n            number.  I  have  contacted  Susan  Flynn  in  legal  to  \ninquire  about  these  calls  or  BP Amoco.  I  was  advised\n            not  to  send  any  confirms  out  blindly  and  that  I  was  \nhandling  it  just  right .  Susan  is  currently  inquiring\n            with  the  other  legal  staff  and  attorneys  about  the  \nmatter.  I  also  was  advised  to  inform  you  to  make  \n            other  members  of  our  team  aware  \"not  to  send  out  blind  \ninformation  requests\" .  The  party  was  calling \n            from  (281)493-0214.  I  will  keep  you  informed.\n\n            Thanks,\n            \n            Willie\n\n\n"

I plan to do more analysis \nwith respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The \nanalysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to \nthe research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to \nmodel.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the \npast we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= \nto LIBOR + X bp.\n\nA quick synapses of difficult items:\n\nCommissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades \nor less frequent trades for smaller amounts\nShort on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and \nhow we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you \nexplained to me today)\nWhat positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact \ntime.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?\n\n\nFrom what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the \nabove  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable \ncomplexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the \nsensitive nature of the business.)  The ideal situation would be for the \ndesks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the \npricing provided.  As mentioned above, I believe that we should be able to \nexplain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to \nestimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information.  \nPerhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what \nloan would be most valuable based on the desk's trading patterns while we \ncould focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible.  If you \ndisagree, please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this \nappropriately.  \n\nSarah\n\n"

The tax provisions  include V&E's comments, however Enron Tax personnel\nshould consider carefully the \"after tax basis\" concept and definition,\nSection 4.9 and Article 11.\n\n3.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the\nproper thresholds and amounts for (i) the Deductible Amount, (ii) the\nliability cap, (iii) Section 4.13 and Section 6.3.\n\n4.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the\nprovisions in Section 4.16 (Insurance) including the continuing post-closing\ninsurance obligations.\n\n5.  The appropriate Enron personnel should advise us regarding the proper\nprocedures for Buyer to participate (observatory capacity) in the\npost-signing business in accordance with Section 7.15.\n\nOnce you have had the opportunity to review the attached agreement, please\ngive me a call to set up a time to discuss your comments and required\nrevisions.\n\n <<Triple Lutz:Redlined PSA.DOC>>\n\n - Redlined PSA.DOC\n\n"

It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south \nof Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night \n(11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter \nPark because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in \nSilver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week \nto Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to \nan Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on \nSunday.\n\nOnce again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we \nmay or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday \n(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  \nThen our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can \nget away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your \nhospitality.  See you soon.\n\nDG\n\n\n\n\n\"Sean Mayers\" <smmayers@earthlink.net> on 02/24/2001 10:17:54 AM\nTo: <Darron.C.Giron@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: March\n\n\nDarron,\n\nThe weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One\nday we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a\npass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass\ndoes not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I\ncould use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited\nuse (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do\nnot know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by\nchance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I\nsome money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to\nWinter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the\nresorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter\nPark/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge.\n\nI have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even\nthough I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone\nand Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared\nto 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far\nthe best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night\nlife (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into\ntown, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is\nCopper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just\nlet me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day\nyou leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the\nrehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming\nup in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a\nroom available.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want\nto do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as\nwell.\n\nIf you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check\nhere for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't\nmeet up with you.\n\nYou guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the\nsummertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming\nout again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and\nKim loved it.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you.\n\nSean\n\n\n"

After looking more closely at the schedule and \nthe way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being \ncompounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple \ninterest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 \n(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based \non the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due \nis $1,171,585.67.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=\n=20\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\n =20\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\n=20\nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\nly=20\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\neased=20\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=\n=20\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=\nt,=20\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\n=20\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\n=20\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\n=20\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\n=20\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\nng=20\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\nn=20\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\ne=20\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\nt=20\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\ned=20\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\nle=20\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\nion. =20\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\n=20\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\n=20\nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\n=20\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\nhich,=20\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron=01,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\nix=20\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\n=20\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\n=20\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\ne=20\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\nts=20\nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\n=20\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\n=20\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\n=20\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\n of our=20\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\nly=20\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\nto=20\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\n=20\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\n=20\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\n=20\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\ners=20\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\n=20\ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\n, the=20\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\net=20\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\n=20\nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\ns=20\nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=\ny=20\nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\n=20\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=\n=20\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\n=20\nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=\n=20\nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\nd=20\nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=\n.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\n=20\nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=\nds=20\nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\n. =20\nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\nir=20\nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20\ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\n=20\narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=\ner=20\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\n=20\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\n=20\nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\n,=20\nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\n=20\nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=\ned;=20\nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\n,=20\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20\nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\nit=20\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\ney=20\nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\n=20\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=\n=20\nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=\ns=20\nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\nhe=20\ncrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=\n will=20\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\nsolutions to the state.

(Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded\nup\nresulting in slightly more than 100%)\n\n18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)\n15%- Southern California Edison (California)\n11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)\n10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)\n10%- Imported power from the Southwest\n7%- State and Federal Agencies\n6%- AES power company\n5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts\n5%- Reliant power company\n4%- Duke power company\n4%- Southern power company\n4%- Dynegy power company\n1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)\n1%- Calpine power company\n1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)\n \nIt should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from\nTexas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's\nenergy\nportfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's\nAES,\nand North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy\nportfolio.\n\nThis list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every\nprovider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to\nidentify those power producers who used market power to ring up high\nprofits\non Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our\ninvestigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power\ncompanies,\nutilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts\ncould\nall be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those\ncompanies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a\nmisrepresentation of fact.\n\n------------------------------\n\nCurt Pringle\nCurt Pringle & Assoc.\n2532 Dupont Drive\nIrvine, CA 92612\n\n(949) 474-4090\n(949) 474-4082 fax\n\n\n"

It is correct that the 1996 letter was superseded by the \namended and restated fuel supply but the situation created by the 1996 letter \nwas not contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  The lenders \nwere not given a copy of the 1996 letter until recently and naturally asked \nto be in the same position created by the 1996 letter which was not \ncontemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  Notwithstanding the \nlenders strong case, I am still trying to argue this and many other issues \nand there is a slight possibility we may be able to convince the lenders they \ndo not need this document.  \n\nWe will continue to do our best to protect Enron's interests (at all levels) \nin this highly complex and difficult financing.  As always, constructive \ncriticism and suggestions to improve our work are very much appreciated.\n\nI will keep you informed of further developments\n\nThank you\n\nFPL\n\n\n\n\nDan J Hyvl@ECT\n12/07/2000 05:28 PM\nTo: Doug Leach/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Ermes Melinchon/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Francisco Pinto \nLeite/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: Amendment to Fuel Supply  \n\nAttached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist \nPQPC.

Also, we need to meet on Entex \nthis week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex \ncan account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these \nnominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.\n\nWe discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I \nthink we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to \nbe a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would \nbe to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve \ncommunication and establish more definitive criteria for changing \nnominations.  \n\nThe end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a \nsolution to past sins and a way forward.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Brenda F Herod                           09/25/2000 10:53 PM\n\t\n\nTo: James I Ducote/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A \nMartin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet H Wallis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nEdward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve HPL Schneider/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Yvette G Connevey/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: Coogler's Response\n\nPlease read the attached summary of Coogler's response to the audit \nfindings.

The additional\nwork is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nRick\n\n\nTo:   Frederick G. Rhodes, Richard J. Feldmann\ncc:\nDate: 09/18/2000 04:29 PM\nFrom: Matthew L.

I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs \nto\nanswer.\n\n1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers \nis\n30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?\n2. Reliant claims that the \"New Technology Contract\" overrides  or is an\nexception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a\nlegitimate exception?\n3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the \nHouston\nDivision is under \"special contracts\" with special pricing, and even though \nthey\nare using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.\nDoes Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?\n4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for\nheating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total\ndivided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce\ndivided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are\nnot a new customer, or a customer that has left.\n5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the\nactual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite\n100 Mcf.\n\nThese are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that\nEnron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of\nthe special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If \nyou\nguys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and\nspoke about it.

This book is a good\ncandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.\n\nIt seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR \nsystem. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative \nbasis,\njumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.\nThis FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a \nbig\njump in VaR.\nThis row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look\nat column D.\n\nThe abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:\n\n a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the\n                     code to review it.\n\n b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in\n                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can \npropose, is to develop for\n                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to \nreview the fwd vol curve\n                    before it is posted.

This is all delivered to Mona, but I think we can get transmission to Gonder for Fallon's energy requirements for a small premium from a variety of players.  \n\nThe proposal is in spreadsheet format.

I hope Lisa has a nice \nbirthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.\n\nGotta go meet someone.\n\nLove,\n\nKay\n\n\n\n\nBill and Rita McCall <bmccall@wcnet.net> on 02/01/2001 03:57:40 PM\nTo: Kay.Mann@enron.com\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Palacios calling\n\nHiKay Kay.

As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. \n\nMany thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along.

I understand that the First Union trade was done as they had \nan agreement in place with ENA but not .Com.  Bearing in mind, that London \ntraders have transacted on behalf of ENA, I expect that we should BTB these \ntrades with .Com ?  (Paul/Denis)   \n\nIf so, I suggest going forward that where we have to do a trade for ENA we \nget Mozam to do it with Markus' approval as he is based in Houston.  Assuming \nthat we get the service agreement in place, we can do the risk mgmt from \nLondon.  If we do it like this then all other issues go away with the \nexception of service agreements which need to be put in place.\n\nI do not believe that it is correct to say that there is only one book. \n(Paul)  We currently have one business,two books: one in london, one in \nhouston.  Each trade is booked against a specific book.  Bryan is quite happy \nto have risk reside in each book assuming legal/tax/regulatory compliance.  \nThere is NO other reason for BTB that I am aware of.  \n\n All risk managment takes place here.  However we will not be able to pay out \nof ENA accounts and will have to request them to do so.  \n\nIt is quite clear that we have the necessary understanding of the issues to \nresolve so let's get this done ASAP.  Bryan can you ask Mary to arrange a \nmeeting for Thurs/Fri.  Paul do you wish to conference in Houston on this ?\n\n\nRegards\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanine Juggins\n12/06/2000 19:56\nTo: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT, Elaine \nBannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark \nTaylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Erica Gut/LON/ECT@ECT, Mahesh Lakhani/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\nThe scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided \nby the Tax group. \n\nLondon based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron \nCredit.com  Ltd (not ENA.)\n\nHouston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA \n(not Enron Credit.com Ltd).\n\nBack to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd \nwill simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be \nlaying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply \nlaying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the \nback to back. \n\nAssuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Credit.com Ltd an \nagreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for \ntheir activity and risk assumed. Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh \nLakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the \nfuture and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service \nagreements/fee arrangements in place.\n\nRegards\nJanine\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Simons\n12/06/2000 17:41\nTo: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT, Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT, David A \nWall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janine \nJuggins/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\nI agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and \nhence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades. From a regulatory \nperspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not \nauthorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated \nentity.  Hope this helps\n\nPaul\n\n\n\nDenis O'Connell\n12/06/2000 14:01\nTo: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT, \nPaul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janine Juggins/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\n\nAs I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in \nENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware \nthere is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or \nEnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should \nnot execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in \nHouston.  \n\nFrom a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate \ntrading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for \nEnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the \nrequisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question \nfor ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  \n\nWhere a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market \nrisk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate \nthe mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact \nthat Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all \ncredit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than \nEnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA \nhas sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this \ninternal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of \nDeliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com \nwhich can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection \nfrom.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms \nregardless of the Enron booking entity.\n\nMark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly \nwhere I haven't hit the mark !).\n\ntks,\n\nDenis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Seyfried\n11/06/2000 13:57\nTo: Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\nIn reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should \nmatch across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two \nseparate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.

Also, we need to meet on Entex \nthis week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex \ncan account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these \nnominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.\n\nWe discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I \nthink we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to \nbe a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would \nbe to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve \ncommunication and establish more definitive criteria for changing \nnominations.  \n\nThe end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a \nsolution to past sins and a way forward.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Brenda F Herod                           09/25/2000 10:53 PM\n\t\n\nTo: James I Ducote/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A \nMartin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet H Wallis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nEdward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve HPL Schneider/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Yvette G Connevey/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: Coogler's Response\n\nPlease read the attached summary of Coogler's response to the audit \nfindings.

Thomas, Houston , (713) 237-2629\nSubject:  Coogler's Response\n\nRick and Fred:\n\nI hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of\nBruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs \nto\nanswer.\n\n1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers \nis\n30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?\n2. Reliant claims that the \"New Technology Contract\" overrides  or is an\nexception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a\nlegitimate exception?\n3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the \nHouston\nDivision is under \"special contracts\" with special pricing, and even though \nthey\nare using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.\nDoes Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?\n4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for\nheating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total\ndivided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce\ndivided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are\nnot a new customer, or a customer that has left.\n5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the\nactual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite\n100 Mcf.\n\nThese are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that\nEnron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of\nthe special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If \nyou\nguys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and\nspoke about it.

Both\nof those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, a\nunit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.\n  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.\n(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company\nelectricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotels\nin California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E.\n\n  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel\npower at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWh\nStarwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August.\n\n  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said it\nexpects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10\nyears.\n\n  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., will\npurchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its\nexperience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E for\nuse of their distribution networks.\n\n  \"That really is our core strength,\" said Harold Buchanan, chief operating\nofficer for Enron Energy Services North America. \"We understand how to manage\nthose risks.\"\n\n  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch\n\n  The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback\nof sorts for Enron.\n\n  The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail power\nmarket just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise\nthe venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residential\ncustomers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected\nprofits.\n\n  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of\npromise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in\nCalifornia, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.\n\n  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego\nthat have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are\ninterested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.\n\n  \"Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that's\nwritten in stone,\" Buchanan said. \"It's far cheaper than what they're paying\nnow with the utilities.\"\n\n  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to\ncomment.\n\n  The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract\nwith Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years\nat $49 per megawatt-hour.\n\n  Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building and\noperating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials\nexpect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.\n\n  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price\nspikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June.\n\n  San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity service\nfor its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council said\ncould shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has said\nit would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.\n\n  An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports such\narrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.\n\n  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for four\nyears at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was too\nhigh.\n\n  California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap\nelectricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.\n\n\n  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nFolder Name: Enron Energy Services\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 80\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTo review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or \ncontact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com \nor by phone at 800-369-7466.

As far as I know, we have never had a \nproduct that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us \nhere?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the \nsecond issue (deals shorter than one month):\n\nEach calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a \nDetermination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less \nthan one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the \nTransaction.\n\nIn some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the \npayment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month \n(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a \ncommercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.\n\nIf mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up \nwith alternative language.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\tHomer Lin\n\t06/01/2001 10:15 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe King/Enron@EnronXGate, Scott \nMoncrieff/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t cc: Carlos Alatorre/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert Quick/Enron@EUEnronXGate\n\t\t Subject: Re: Tanker Freight Long Description\n\nMark,\n\nLooks good.

Here's the catch, pre-approval means that the IOU has to be \nwilling (generally) to accept a bit more risk.  They don't like that.  The \nCPUC has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this Commission \ndefinitely doesn't like that idea.  So often, the utility puts up a proposal \nthat the Commission says places to much risk with granny.  The CPUC often \nissues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control \n(read \"second-guessing\") with the Commission (and therefore leaves to much \nrisk with the utility).  In the end, the utility often \"declines\" the \nCommission's offer.  However, it can be done.  For example, under \nCalifornia's restructuring law, the utility's purchases from the PX are just \nand reasonable, period.   (Of course, we see where the incentive built into \nthat mechanism got us--a debacle.)  \n\nDo you have PG&E's and Edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some \nweeks ago, in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms?  The \nCommission didn't adopt them wholesale, and the decision has made PG&E and \nEdison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful RFPs.\n\nThis at all helpful?"

The company told the CPUC that \nSouthern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen \nby $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the \nwithholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the \nsupply basins and the California border. \n\n\"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential \nhas been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, \ncollusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and \nmerchants,\" Edison told the CPUC. \n\nThe company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC \nregarding this issue and is seeking a recision of \"certain allegedly \ncollusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas \nsuppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas \nprices by wrongfully withholding capacity.\" It notes the complaint \n\"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis \ndifferential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 \nmillion annually since the beginning of 1998.\" \n\nEdison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of \n$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, \nto calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the \nmonth of October and every month going forward. It estimated September \nbidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in \nEdison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to \ncertain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month \nprior, the company told the CPUC. \"No mechanism exists to recapture the \nincrease in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in \nanother forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.\" \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We even had a=\n good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =\nof us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20\n\nRegardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=\ne have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.

Thank you.  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: jshorter@txu.com [mailto:jshorter@txu.com]\nSent: Monday, January 07, 2002 6:15 PM\nTo: Tricoli, Carl\nCc: tpounds@txu.com; jburt1@txu.com\nSubject: Enron/TXU Exposure summary\n\n\n\nCarl,\n\nPlease review the attached.

We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to \npurchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at \nthe 45,000 base.

My comments/questions were:\n\nWhat is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as \nagent for the client?  What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the \ntrade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable?  The margin will secure the \nrisk between treansaction and confirmation with the counterparty.  the broker \nwill pay liquidated damages if counterparty does not accept the trade.  (risk \nis essentially 1-3 days)\n\nI assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker, \ncovering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to \nbind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of \nagent/liability of agent/margin arrangements)  Yes.  Mark Taylor is drafting \nthe agreement.  the agreement will lay out the margin requirements, \nliquidated damages, etc.  I am not sure that the broker is acting as a agent \nfor the customer as the customer may not even know that the broker is \ntransacting on EnronOnline.\n\nI assume that the client will be an approved EOL counterparty with trading \naccess for the particular product Not neccesarily.  the customer must however \nhave a profile set up in enronOnline and must have a credit headroom in \nEnronOnline.  We can potentially paper the transaction under normal OTC \nprocess.\n\nWe will need to ensure that the client agrees to be bound by each trade \nconcluded through the agent, notwithstanding the intermediation of the agent \n(it would seem to me that we should create special ETAs/PAs for this purpose \n- e.g. each trade is effected by the \"click\" of the agent, not the client; \nthe ETA does not contemplate intermediation; the PA relates to the use of \npasswords by a principal and not its agent)  Mark is also drafting a BTA \n(broker transaction agreement.  Once again the broker is not acting as agent \nrather they will release the rights and obligations under the transaction to \nthe counterparty.\n\nThe agent will, in its terms of business with the client, need to ensure that \nit is authorised to bind the client with respect all trades, whether effected \nonline (including EOL) or offline  This is not the case today in OTC \ntransactions and will not neccessarily be the case with the EnronOnline \nbroker client.\n\nThe agent will need to meet the usual legal/regulatory/financial tests, as if \nit were acting as principal - e.g. in the case of derivatives trades, the \nagent must be regulated to carry on its business by the UK SFA [no doubt, the \nCFTC swaps exemption test will also need to be met]  Lets discuss\n\nThe agent must also be a corporate or similar commercial enterprise The \nbroker must be financially able to meet margin requirements\n\nLook forward to your response.\n\nThanks\n\nJustin\n\n\n\n\nTo: Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron, Michael \nBridges/NA/Enron@ENRON, Teresa Smith/Corp/Enron@Enron \n\nSubject: Broker Client Process flow\n\nWe are currently in discussions with 3-4 brokers (including GFI in London) to \nallow them to transact on behalf of their customers via EnronOnline.

I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  \n\nRecognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  \n\nI presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n\n  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGeaccone, Tracy  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 11:56 AM\nTo:\tAmbler, John\nSubject:\tRE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through \n\nHave the Steve Kean numbers been included in his budget and allocated out for 2002?\n\nThanks\n\nTracy\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAmbler, John  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 11:37 AM\nTo:\tGeaccone, Tracy\nSubject:\tRE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through \n\nTracy,\n\nThank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  \n\nBy the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.

However the fact \nremains that fundamentals have changed little \nin the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this \nmkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a \nfirm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt \nmarket still steeply inverted for the winter versus\nthe rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt \nexperiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coast\ntrading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 \n2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec\n2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the \norigin markets are structured in a steep contango for\nthe remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation \naside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anything\ndemand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down \nand the financial markets under pressure and forecasts\nfor European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked \nsell off for second half of the year is unlikely we\nsee the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than \ncontango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higher\nof absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 \nFob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is still\nplenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will \nend up buying into it rather than risk the wait and\nsee game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that \nthe cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated\nit's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.\n\nSPOT TRADES \n\n150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo \nbasis 6000 kcal/kg\n160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo \nbasis 6400 kcal/kg\n150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at \n$30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.\n2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively. \nStrike price  is $40.50 basis Amsterdam/\nRotterdam and expiry is Feb 15 and Aug 15. Premium - $0.50 cents.\n\n\nSELLING SIDE\n\nBritish Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to \ncurrent contract we have with them which runs out\nend March.\nScotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR \ndeal and sell incremental cape for March \narrival.\nH Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.\nEndessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 \nFob South Africa.\nNCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising \nEOL in the next week to hedge some of their \nimplied short position.\nHeidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for \nNovember delivery at $47.50.\nBremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen \nsupplying them some 850,000mt of generic\nquality coal on an annual basis.\nBewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on \ndelivered stockpile basis\nENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob \nARA.\nBraunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into \nNordenham at $43.75 cif.\n Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for \nApril/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.\n\n\nBUYING SIDE\n\nDuiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us \nbuying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to get\nback to us within the next few days.\nDrummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - \nthanks!!\nKrutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of \nKrutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian\nmkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our \nportfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business\ngoing forward.\nAnker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for \n2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fob\nMaputo level.\nMasefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa \nMarta for 2001.\nCoal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out \nof Durban for 2001\nCurrently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for \n2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.\n\n\nWe currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in \nAmsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backend\nof the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov \n26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell into\nthe mkt.\n\nEOL\n\nMuch of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from \nGlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch \nan e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA \ndelivery point. Details of operational functionality\nare scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they \nthemselves do not know but general consensus reckons\nit will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as \ncompetition, if successful it could provide us with more access\nto markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games \nto be had with the various producers.  \n\nTotal volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of \ninterest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt \nconditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money \noptions. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal \nplayers are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which \nincreasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros and\nafter that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.\n\nGAMEPLAN\n\nWe had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of \nwhich is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between\n$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and \nDurban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South\nAfrican material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some \n2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -\nour efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is \nout there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mkt\nin either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any \ndownside potential with a host of put options which the utilities\nare keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we \nneed to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better\nshape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of \ndiversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.\nWhile the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of \nan option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as\nmuch flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.\n\nBest Regards\nJez\n\n\n"

One of their \nprincipal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies \nrecently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services \nto other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in \nArizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me \nconfidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the \ninterconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that \ninterconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power \nPlant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide \ncontract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked \nin writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these \nfacilities. \n\nDoes TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for \nCitizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority \nto conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform \nthese services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an \naffiliate problem for us if we \"share\" operating employees?  If these \nthreshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide \ncontract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do \nso, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear \nat first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, \nremember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and \nEPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure \nbetween the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts \nfrom both pipes as well as the plant site. \n\nAlthough I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards \ntransportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of \nthis negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be \nhappy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me \non the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time \nuntil LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited \nconsideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have \nany questions.\n\n\n\n\n"

The issues is whether \nthe one year terms is notice or elapsed time.  This suggests time is of the \nessense in switching back to standard offer.\nThe 2nd term would be okay but 12 would be a lot better than 36.  And 24 is \npretty good too. 36 is better than a kick in the head.\n\nAnd a principle that, \nDA customers would have access to the existing generation, at cost, the same \nas all other industrials, should be added.\n\nWe should not sign off on this solution (if they are seeking it) unless we \nhave the option to switch back to standard offer.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON on 12/18/2000 11:52 AM\nSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\nTo: Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Dennis \nBenevides/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry \nKingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: Revised CESG Outline\n\nFYI.

After looking more closely at the schedule and \nthe way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being \ncompounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple \ninterest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 \n(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.

While not all of the changes will\n     be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday\n     activities.   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we\n     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring\n     to  increase  your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize\n     disruption to our day-to-day business.\n\n     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp.  Security  resides  in  our\n     business  controls  organization.   You  can contact this organization\n     through  their  website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>),  by phone\n     (713-345-2804),     or     by    email    (CorporateSecurity@enron.com\n     <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director,\n     Business  Controls,  leads  this  organization.   Please  feel free to\n     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions, or to\n     report security threats.\n\n     We  have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures\n     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel\n     advisory.\n\n     Access to the Enron Center\n\n     Over  the  next few days, the following access control procedures will\n     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  (and  other  facilities  where\n     practical):\n\n          ?   As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter\n             the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to\n             the bearer.\n\n          ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present\n             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S.\n             driver's  license,  U.S.  or foreign passport, or some form of\n             U.S. federal, state or local identification).\n\n          ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID\n             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must\n             completely  fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without\n             a  valid  photo  ID  (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign\n             passport,  or  some  form  of  U.S.  federal,  state  or local\n             identification)  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron\n             Center.\n\n          ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron\n             employee or badged contractor at all times.\n\n          ?   Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an\n             Enron  employee  or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's\n             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged\n             contractor,   and  escorted  to  their  appointment.   At  the\n             conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to\n             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor, the visitor\n             badge  collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the\n             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged\n             contractor.\n\n          ?   Employees are also being asked to participate in the security\n             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines; report\n             suspicious  activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open\n             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors\n             open, allowing \"tail gating\" by others.\n\n     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be\n     instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that all employees be patient during\n     congested  times  in  the  lobby.   As we proceed and obtain increased\n     guard   personnel  and  equipment,  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to\n     decrease.   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted\n     for the security of all our employees.\n\n\n     Travel Advisory Update\n\n     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we have two important\n     recommendations:\n\n          ?   While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security\n             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be\n             avoided.   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel\n             during  this  time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia,\n             Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia,\n             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In  addition,  we\n             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West\n             Bank,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be\n             very carefully considered.\n\n          ?    For  non-U.S.  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States,\n             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation.\n             There  have  been  several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens\n             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for\n             documentation  when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights.  As  a\n             result,  we  suggest  that all non-U.S. citizens who currently\n             reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent\n             Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport, Form I-94 and\n             Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent\n             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as\n             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears\n             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the\n             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over\n             the  age  of  18 to carry his/her \"registration\" documentation\n             with  them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident\n             Card,  Form  I-94  card, Employment Authorization Card, Border\n             Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card. Immigration\n             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers\n             for   \"registration\"   documentation,  but  in  light  of  the\n             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere, it would\n             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving\n             your current lawful status.\n\n     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the\n     Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.\n\n\n"

I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary.\n\nI would suggest the hardest part is \"anticipating\" these changes.  here are \nsome examples:  UK Climate Change Levy, even other Government Departments in \nthe UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor \ndelivers it to Parliament.  Turkish fuel consumption tax, I believe, was \nmodified without prior notice.  In Romania, Doug Wood met with the Energy \nMinister on the proposed Gas Decree, and 2 days later they passed another \ndraft of the decree, which had been rejected before Christmas, verbatim.  Tom \nBriggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo, which \naffects all of our UK assets, can swing up or down by 10% per annum, and \ncannot be predicted/modelled (we and our consultants have tried).  Decisions \nby Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland, notwithstanding \nour PPA, was another example.  The list goes on.  I remain a sceptic that all \nof these risks, or even many of them, can be \"identified\" a priori.  Once we \nfact them, we do assess/mitigate.  In Europe, I think we accept these as \n\"business\" risks, that the regulatory team responds to.   mcs     \n\n\n\n\nJames D Steffes@EES\n09/02/2000 21:02\nTo: Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES \n\nSubject: Re: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets  \n\nMark --\n\nThanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.\n\nThe definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of \nSovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory \nRisk is a \"legal\" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies \nEnron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in \nthe energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes \nand export - import policies.  Political Risk is a \"supra-legal\" action that \nhas the same impact (e.g., expropriation).\n\nCurrently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying \nto put in place a \"standard\" process to review and analyze regualtory risk \naround the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Risk \nManagement, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements of \nany risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) \nmitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that the \nmost difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk \nevent.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an \nassigned person to \"manage\" our activities so that Enron does not face an \nassociated loss.\n\nMy goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would \ninclude having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the \nreason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals. \n\nWhen you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and \ngo through my thoughts with you.  \n\nThanks.\n\nJDS\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMark Schroeder@ECT\n02/09/2000 05:48 AM\nTo: James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES\ncc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Fiona \nGrant/LON/ECT@ECT, Philip Davies/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets  \n\nJim - overnight I realised you need to add our project in Turkey (Fiona \nGrant) and Poland (Philip Davies).  I have not given you any one person, as \nthe regulatory issues seem to be country/environment specific, and instead I \nhave given you the names of each person with country responsibility.  Indeed, \nat year-end we completed a financial transaction (Project Margaux), in which \nregulatory risk was reviewed.  A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be \nhelpful, e.g., in most of these markets, trading arrangements are being \nre-written, or developed for the first time, this put existing PPAs under \npressure.  Would energy taxes, carbon taxes/trading, transmission pricing \n(both for evacuation of power, and delivery of gas), changes in property \ntax/fuel tax regimes, risk of price regulation, all be included?  Do you have \nchecklist?  We can identify these risks, what is meant by \"manage\"?

Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.\n\nIn addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.

While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in \"Schedule\" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.\n\nI don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it \"right\" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.\n\nRegards,\nTim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPostlethwaite, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 08, 2002 1:10 PM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Belden, Tim\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara\nSubject:\tDec and Jan liquidations\n\nIt has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.\n\nWhat I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tScholtes, Diana  \nSent:\tThursday, January 03, 2002 8:43 AM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie\nCc:\tGilbert, Scotty; Postlethwaite, John; Belden, Tim\nSubject:\tJanuary Settlements\n\nLeslie,\n\nI'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  \n\nI also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  \n\nIf there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.\n\nDiana Scholtes\nWest Desk \n503-464-3807\n"

She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.\n\nSabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?

I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.

I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.

I'm going to try and meet her today.\n\nSabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.

However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.\n\nIn addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  \n\nThanks,\nStacey\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBelden, Tim  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 09, 2002 10:26 AM\nTo:\tPostlethwaite, John; Reeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Miller, Don (Asset Mktg); Wax, Brandon\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara; Presto, Kevin M.\nSubject:\tRE: Dec and Jan liquidations\n\nYesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in \"Schedule\" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.\n\nI don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it \"right\" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.\n\nRegards,\nTim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPostlethwaite, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 08, 2002 1:10 PM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Belden, Tim\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara\nSubject:\tDec and Jan liquidations\n\nIt has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.\n\nWhat I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tScholtes, Diana  \nSent:\tThursday, January 03, 2002 8:43 AM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie\nCc:\tGilbert, Scotty; Postlethwaite, John; Belden, Tim\nSubject:\tJanuary Settlements\n\nLeslie,\n\nI'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  \n\nI also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  \n\nIf there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.\n\nDiana Scholtes\nWest Desk \n503-464-3807\n"

Can \nsomeone help me with this?\n\nSince we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would \nsay we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  \nHowever, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our \nlanguage.  Or they could tell us to remove the \"subject to transportation and \nfuel\" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and \nfuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  \nHowever, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the \nlanguage means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  \nAny comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.\n\n\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Drew Fossum                           12/05/2000 05:18 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Maria Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary \nDarveaux/ET&S/Enron@ENRON \n\nSubject: TW\n\nShould we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances \nprior to netting and trading?
