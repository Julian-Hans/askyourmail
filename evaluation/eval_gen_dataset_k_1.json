Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?\n\n\t2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?\n\n\t3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?\n\n\tI am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking\n\tat Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.\n\n\tPlease let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will\n\tget a room and let everyone know date and time.  \n\n\tThanks. Lynn"
