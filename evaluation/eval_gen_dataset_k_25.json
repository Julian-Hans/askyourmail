In addition, If I will be here  in Baton \nRouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?  I am able \nto pursue an internship in large part because of the department's  \ncooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and \nor  teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been  \ntold that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to  \nrock the boat as little as possible.\n?\nI realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I  say \ninternship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my  \nstipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by  \nEnron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must  be \nfollowed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is  \nnecessary to move to the next step in that process.\n?\nI will be in Houston on July 8 & 9 for my wife's  grandmother's 80th \nbirthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in  town?on the preceding \nFriday, or following Monday for a visit and/or  interview.? If not, given the \nrelatively close proximity between Baton  Rouge and Houston, I would be happy \nto come at another time.\n?\nThanks again,\nShane Green\n?\n\n"

Seems like in Global Counterparty both the counterparties are \nset up exactly the way it should be. The request below is to change the \ntradename's name from Nicor Gas Company to Northen Ilinois Gas Company dba \nNicor Gas Company, which I don't have any documentation or instructions for. \nUpon my conversation with Sandy Allison, Attorney Nicor Gas at Ph (630) \n983-8676 x2882 all the contracts and legal binding documents should carry the \nname Nicor Gas Company, and so does the Assumed Name Certificate says. In \naddition, Marcia Nawrocki, Attorney Nicor Gas on her fax cover sheet attached \nwith the Certificate, instructed to \"use NICOR GAS COMANY\".\n\nIn lieu of the above facts, Global Counterparty does not feel necessary to \nmake any changes in its database. \nRegards!\n\nAdnan Patel\nx58335\n\n\n\nFrom: Tana Jones@ECT on 08/23/2000 08:49 AM\nTo: Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Adnan Patel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Anthony Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company  \n\nSusan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company \nafter receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name \ncertificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under \nthe name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed \ntheir name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas \nCompany.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern \nIllinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy \nDickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their \nmaster with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed \nname certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after \nthis, it seems like we need two counterparty names \"Northern Illinois Gas \nCompany\" and \"Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company\".  Upon \nreceipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I \nwill contact Credit and the Online team.\n\n\n\n\tStacey Richardson\n\t08/17/2000 04:49 PM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Adnan Patel/Corp/Enron@ENRON\n\t\t cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stacy E Dickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom \nMoran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nMary G Gosnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill D Hare/HOU/ECT@ect, Linda S \nBryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bridgette Anderson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan \nBailey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karen Lambert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anthony Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company\n\nOK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts \nunder Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to \nNicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change \ndocumentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ \ncompany and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up \nunder Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract \ncan be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.\n\nI apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.\n\nThanks,\nStacey\n\n\n\nAdnan Patel@ENRON on 08/17/2000 04:20:24 PM\nTo: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Stacy E Dickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank L \nDavis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary G Gosnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nStacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill D Hare/HOU/ECT@ect, Linda S \nBryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bridgette Anderson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan \nBailey/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company  \n\nPer my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas \nCompany changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company \nis the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the \nattorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name \"Northern Illinois \nGas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company\" eversince the name change happened. He \nsaid they had been using both names \"contractually\" and interchangeably even \nthough it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.\n\nI'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks \nlike thats going to happen:\nThe main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the \ntrades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we \ncould have a Tradename set up as \"Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor \nGas Company\" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.\n\nNicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further \nclarifications in this matter.\n\nAdnan Patel\nGlobal Counterparty\nx58335\n\n\n\nFrom: Tana Jones@ECT on 08/17/2000 03:47 PM\nTo: Stacy E Dickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Adnan \nPatel/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company\n\nThere appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading \nwith these entities.\n\nWe have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company \nd/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not \nset up this way it need to be.\n\nPhysical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.\n\nThere is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only \ntrading being done with this entity is online gas trading.\n\nThe issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under \nboth Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will \nresolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical \ngas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.\n\nWhen we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we \nwant to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the \ncorrect Password Application to match out intended trading partners.\n\nSorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.\n\nI expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.\n\nCall if you have questions or concerns.

Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be \na great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which \nmeans that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is \nprepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we \nproceed with as simple a transaction as possible.\n\nI would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the \ntransaction as soon as possible.\n\nFred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day \ntoday, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.\n\nAs soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the \ngroup.\n\nRegards,\n\nBen"
