At the moment, the focus has clearly had to be on managing the restructuring process.  However, clearly, going forward we will need to sit down as a group and define our priorities going forward.  I'm away next week, but will be setting something up for the following week to begin this process.  I'm also happy to meet bilaterally and will arrange this also.\n\nPaul\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHaizmann, Jan  \nSent:\t18 October 2001 12:02\nTo:\tDawson, Paul\nCc:\tHennemeyer, Paul; Shapiro, Richard; Radmacher, Andreas\nSubject:\tFW: Today's Bandwidth Market Report - EBS Article - New Priorities for myself \n\nPaul,\n\nSince the broadband venture of Enron is about to come to an end, I would like to meet up with you and set new priorities for the coming 6 months. As of 1 November, I will be fully available for other business units. Currently, I bill about 33 % of my time on Germany, mostly for the ongoing cartel procedures and some tax related issues.\n\nSince I am some sort of versatile guy with some language capacities, I could take over some responsibilities in following continental markets (Germany\nAustria, Switzerland, BeNeLux, or  France). I also could assist Peter Styles in some Brussels related matters, since after 5 years of professional activity there, I have a good apprehension of how the European Institution system works.\n\nI am in principle open for any suggestion, as long as it gives me a clearly defined area of responsibility and a good learning experience.  The current downsize of our group should leave some vacant areas to pick up. I would also expect some priority setting. Let me know when it is convenient for you to meet. \n\nThanks\n\nJan\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tReyna, Margo  \nSent:\t17 October 2001 14:42\nTo:\tBolton, Scott; Burns, Stephen; Grimes, Michael; Haizmann, Jan; Hamilton, Allison; Kishigami, Kikumi; Leibman, Lara; Nunas, Maurice; Petrochko, Mona L.; Stroup, Kerry\nSubject:\tToday's Bandwidth Market Report - EBS Article\n\nA rather interesting article about the fate of EBS appears in today's BMR.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\n\nAcquiring a Company\n\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\nviability\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\neither\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\nA,\nand so on.\n\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\nprice\nthey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\nthe press.\n\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\nproject\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\nanything less than $50.\n\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\noffers\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's\nstock?\n\n     $______ per/share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This would \nenable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which \ntook place during the period for which each FX desk was responsible for \nmanaging the FX positions. \n\nRegards\nJanine\n\n\n\n\nDale Neuner\n11/10/2000 22:31\nTo: Amita Gosalia/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Brent \nHendry/NA/Enron@Enron, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William \nStuart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Blumenthal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shane Dallmann/LON/ECT@ECT, \nJason Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Janine \nJuggins/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert \nB Cass/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: FX Issues\n\n\nThis e-mail is admittedly long, so I have classified the issues:\n\nLegal/Tax Issue:\n\nI have been told by the FX group here in Houston that London traders are able \nto act on the behalf of the US FX Desk because the transactions they do are \nfor hedging purposes only (no proprietary trading). For example, the FX \ntransactions that are done by Trena McFarland in London are done on the \nbehalf of our Houston office, so Houston books the transaction, manages the \nrisk, and writes the Confirmation in the name of ENA.\n\nThis being the case, (i) can we apply the same logic on the internal FX \ntransactions that will be managed by both the US and UK traders and have the \ntransacting entity as ENA (ii) if we do does it gives us the necessary tax \nrelief, or (iii) should we stick the Metals structure where the transactions \nare offered by Enron North America, acting through it's agent, Enron Europe \nFinance and Trading Limited. While this may be an Internal Only Product Type \ntoday, what effect, if any, would the choice of trading entities have on our \nability to offer these Products externally.\n\nTechnology Issue:\n\nDavid - Stuart has explained to me that the US FX Desk now views these \ncurrency exchange products as financial products. This is contrary to \nprevious discussions where we felt that any currency exchange involving an \nIndex would be considered financial, while any 'strict exchange' would be \nconsidered a physical transaction. The change is based on conversations \nStuart has had with the Metals traders wherein they would like to see this \nexchange product as a financial product. If we accept this logic, (i) do I \nneed to create a Deal Type for 'Par Forward Swap' for the first FX Index \nProduct Type that we did as well as a 'Forward Swap' for these transactions, \nor is it acceptable to leave these both as swaps, and (ii) regardless of the \nDeal Type classification discussed in (i), I will need to create a new \nProduct Type for the 'strict exchange' - either as a physical or financial \nproduct. Additionally, if I set this up as Financial Product, I have the \nIndex attribute in the template to contend with, because there is no Index; \nand if I set this up as a Physical Product, I have the Location attribute to \ncontend with, because there is no Location. Naturally we can put something \ncheesy in to fill the gap since it's internal, but if we ever decide to go \nexternal we will need a new template - and from experience with the PJM Power \n(Weather Desk) Product Type, templates requires an 'and if' statement are \nhard to develop.\n\nDale\n\n\n"

We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.\nThe PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.\nThis effort would extend outside FA&A.\nPlease advise.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBarnes, Caroline  \nSent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 11:29 AM\nTo:\tHayslett, Rod\nCc:\tStern, Ellis; Sullivan, Michael\nSubject:\tNeed for Rutherford Consullting Complete\n\nMike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.

If direct assignmnet of the congestion and/or designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model.

If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. \nWhen the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit. \nIt would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Steffes, James D. \nSent: Sun 10/7/2001 12:53 PM \nTo: Nicolay, Christi L.; Novosel, Sarah; Shapiro, Richard; Twiggs, Thane \nCc: Robertson, Linda \nSubject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT\n\n\nThane --\n\nBased on Wood's statements while at the PUCT, what issues will most likely drive his choice of a congestion management model?

We=\n=20\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\n =20\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\n=20\nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\nly=20\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\neased=20\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=\n=20\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=\nt,=20\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\n=20\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\n=20\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\n=20\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\n=20\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\nng=20\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\nn=20\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\ne=20\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\nt=20\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\ned=20\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\nle=20\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\nion. =20\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\n=20\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\n=20\nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\n=20\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\nhich,=20\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron=01,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\nix=20\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\n=20\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\n=20\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\ne=20\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\nts=20\nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\n=20\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\n=20\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\n=20\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\n of our=20\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\nly=20\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\nto=20\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\n=20\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\n=20\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\n=20\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\ners=20\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\n=20\ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\n, the=20\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\net=20\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\n=20\nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\ns=20\nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=\ny=20\nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\n=20\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=\n=20\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\n=20\nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=\n=20\nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\nd=20\nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=\n.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\n=20\nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=\nds=20\nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\n. =20\nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\nir=20\nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20\ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\n=20\narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=\ner=20\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\n=20\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\n=20\nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\n,=20\nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\n=20\nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=\ned;=20\nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\n,=20\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20\nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\nit=20\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\ney=20\nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\n=20\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=\n=20\nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=\ns=20\nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\nhe=20\ncrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=\n will=20\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\nsolutions to the state.

This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=\ngned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=\nisk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=\nay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=\ncom in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=\nn why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=\n intercom is repaired.\n\nThere have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=\n bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=\n levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=\n the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=\ne previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=\ntaff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=\nly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=\n site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=\n over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=\nms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=\n,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=\n have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=\ncomplished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=\nldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=\n tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20\n\nWhile it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=\nce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=\nr functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=\nr Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =\nthem to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =\nSaturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=\nnterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=\n this time it was significant.=20\n\nThis past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=\n corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =\nit was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=\nacted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =\nproceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=\nuccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=\n Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=\nd that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=\n at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=\nindler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=\nator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=\ndler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=\n in an extra hour before help arrived.\n\nI am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =\nno delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=\nrapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=\nvators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=\n the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =\nthese inspections since they have people here at night. =20\n\nI sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=\nterday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=\n not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=\nonally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=\ncceptable.\n\nRandy\n\n"

I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs \nto\nanswer.\n\n1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers \nis\n30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?\n2. Reliant claims that the \"New Technology Contract\" overrides  or is an\nexception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a\nlegitimate exception?\n3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the \nHouston\nDivision is under \"special contracts\" with special pricing, and even though \nthey\nare using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.\nDoes Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?\n4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for\nheating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total\ndivided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce\ndivided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are\nnot a new customer, or a customer that has left.\n5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the\nactual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite\n100 Mcf.\n\nThese are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that\nEnron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of\nthe special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If \nyou\nguys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and\nspoke about it.

It seems to me that the framework I\nhave been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues and\nallows describing the salient features of power markets.  I feel a brief\ninfo may inform you what have I been up to.\n\nConceptually speaking, my approach relies on the understudying that the\nabsence of cash and carry implies non-hedgibility of the most fundamental\nbuilding blocks of power market - forward contracts of hourly duration.\nThis clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices.  I have been\nable to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium, and calculate its\nimpact on pricing of other products.  In particular, the method allows\nconsistent generation of hourly forward curve (per each geographic region),\nhence generation of forward curves of longer duration.  It provides us not\nonly with forward curves, but also their physical (not risk-neutral)\ndistribution.  It also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forward\ncurve with respect to the volumetric risk.  As a fundamental  input ,  I\nconsider the ratio of properly compounded generation output (load) and the\ncorresponding maximum available generation supply.  The first one is well\nobservable and forecastable due to its stationarity.  The second one  is\ndefined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of the\nregion.  Much of the required information is in the public domain.\n\nThe market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio and\nthe calendar time.  This time dependence of the market price of risk allows\ncapturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time, and its\ndependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and the\nreality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply higher\ncompensation do the investors expect.\n\nI have also realized that the transmission related factors may be\nincorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner.\n\nThis approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochastic\nprocess dependent on the volumetric factors, among other things.  It allows\nposing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keeping\ntheir variance under control in a very elegant and robust way.\n\nI have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototype\nsoftware reflecting all these issues.  My inability to complete this program\nhas been resulted from the severe instability, lack of access and the cash\nflow problems I have experienced in the last few years.  I have also\nunderstood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the\n\"grandpa's garage.\"\n\nNevertheless, I think I have developed a very systematic and robust\nunderstanding and methodology, and at least, I have convinced myself that\nthis approach leads to a comprehensive system.\n\nWith all this said, I don't want to make an impression of a stiff person,\nwho has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push it\nforward.  I have always been very flexible, and in my consulting experience,\nI have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients.  In my short\nperiod of employment with Altra I have been very ethical, I have played by\nthe rules, I have done whatever I have been asked to do, and have been a\nteam player.  The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to do\nwith me personally.  They have been respectful to me, they have valued me as\ncapable person, but have found that given the direction of the company\n(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), \"further\nAltra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go.\"  It was almost\nformulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.\nAs an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,\nsomething that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to its\nend, too.  I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation from\nAltra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.\ncorporate style, etc.  I have no doubts that I can function equally well in\neither environment.\n\nI wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that my\njoining Enron becomes a possibility.\n\nRegards,\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - martin.doc\n"

The parti=\nes=20\nfurther agree that the term =01&Transporter=018 when used in this Contract,=\n=20\nincluding, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any=20\ncompany acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agr=\nee=20\nthat Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such=20\nTransporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the=\n=20\nsame extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any su=\nch=20\nRepurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes.  =20\n\nIn the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like=\n=20\nthis Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to=\n=20\nsection 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are=20\nplaced in the line,  2 will be made up by the transporter  the cost is=20\nEnrons, and 10 would be delivered to NEGM.   And so the  opposite holds for=\n=20\nNEGM.  If 10 could not be accepted by NEGM, its transporter would respond=\n=20\naccordingly, and NEGM would be responsible for the cost.\n\nEnron's  concern is with NEGM's desire to claim force majeure as a result o=\nf=20\nan event by its customer downstream.
