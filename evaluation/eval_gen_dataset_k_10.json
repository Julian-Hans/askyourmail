Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, \npending agreement from the Office of the Chair.\n2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a \ncomparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's \nportfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to \nbe reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )\n4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be \nreported to technical support in the event of a failure.  \n\nThe benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time \nfor completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning \nof the next trading day.\n\nEarly in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each \nbusiness area/valuation system for the following:\na) current state\nb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking\nc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - \nMarket Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - \nimplementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )\n\nUpon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full \ncommercial signoff\n\nRegards\n\nMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 24/12/2000 13:56 \n---------------------------\n\n\nMike Jordan\n19/12/2000 16:02\nTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market \nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \nHardy/LON/ECT@ECT, John Paskin/LON/ECT@ECT, Brian Hudson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark \nPickering/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nJust to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out\n\nThe elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment \nfrom Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability \nto kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and \nI will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting \nthis change\n\nThe revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any \nsystem failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver \ncompleted results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks \nin the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in \ndelivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of \nmeeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we \nwill have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve \ninput validation processes on trade date.\n\nIndeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to \ndeliver\n\nOfficialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy \nis in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( \nHouston 4 AM )\nFlash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )\nCompletion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( \nHouston 11AM )\n\nJames and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible \nchanges to business processes that could improve these times. This is in \naddition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of \ndelivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in \ndelivering a trade date control process.\n\nI can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we \nare dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. \nPlease feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.\n\nRegards\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 19/12/2000 15:06 \n---------------------------\n\n\nJames New\n18/12/2000 09:10\nTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley \nDyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary \nHickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nRick,\n\nThanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L \nprocess. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start \ntoday with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions \nand VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of \nflash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. \n \nI will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes \ninto the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and \nthe obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised \ntomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is \njust one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most \nserious problem.\n\nJames\n\n\n   \n\n\nFrom:  Rick Buy                                                             \n15/12/2000 21:59\t\n\t\n\t\n\t                           \n\t\n\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike \nJordan/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nNeed your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, \np&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves \nbefore submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not \nnecessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of \nbusiness London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it \nwould be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the \nefficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys \ninitiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
