1. At each month end, the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even if that day is a weekend.
2. Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.
3. RisktRAC IT rolls the results of the calculation back to the last business day to ensure the information aligns with the business day's date.
4. The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.
5. If the month end falls on a weekend, the setup includes choosing the Non-exact Libor Based Curve to use the last business day's interest rate curve, selecting the Valuation Date as the last day of the month, and contacting PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

Casey Evans confirmed that everything is usually dated as of the last business day, and they publish and export based on that date as well.

Generated Answer: Enron Europe and its directors, as mentioned by Mark Evans in November 2001, are currently facing two main issues: 1. **Continuing to Trade**: The directors have to ensure that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation. They need confirmation from senior management about the positive outlook for the future to continue operations. 2. **Filing Accounts**: The directors cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are confident about having adequate funds in the medium term. This requires more comfort, including details about new facilities and expected financial support from corporate headquarters. The lack of a usual support letter from Corp. is also a concern that they need to address promptly.

Expected Answer: John J Shoobridge highlights that the ISDA document is not translated into Spanish, which puts it at a disadvantage compared to shorter local documents.
Generated Answer: In January 2000, John J Shoobridge highlighted that the ISDA document faces a "cultural" disadvantage because it is not translated into Spanish, which he believes would be beneficial. He expressed concern that Latin American countries tend to use shorter documents in their local language, and he questioned why the ISDA document is not available in Spanish, given the potential for selling risk management products to Latin American markets. He emphasized that the lack of a Spanish version puts them at a competitive disadvantage against local documents prepared by experienced professionals.

Query: What steps are being proposed by Bruce Harris to manage the Copel shares in December 2000?
Expected Answer: The proposed steps include sending one certificate back to BONY and splitting it into three new certificates, forming a new CayCo to transfer shares, selling existing CayCos into Whitewing Fund, and establishing an efficient mechanism for converting shares to unrestricted ADRs.
Generated Answer: Bruce Harris has proposed the following steps to manage the Copel shares in December 2000:

1. Send one certificate back to BONY and split it into three new certificates, with two certificates for approximately 1.25 million shares each and the balance for about 5 million shares.
2. Form a new CayCo and sell or transfer the two 1.25 million share tranches to this NewCo, which needs to happen the following week.
3. Pending structuring efforts and an affirmative corporate decision, the two existing CayCos that own the Copel shares will be sold into the Whitewing Fund, which would involve about 12.5 million shares going to Whitewing while the certificates remain in the vault. This is expected to occur in the last week of the year.
4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely, and one tranche of 1.25 million shares will be put into a brokerage account, with assistance from Sheila Glover.
5. Work out with Sheila, Skadden, and BONY to establish a mechanism to convert the full 1.25 million share certificate to unrestricted ADRs or reissue new certificates for every small sale, with points to sell these shares being looked for, and a similar process for the other 1.25 million tranche to be repeated in three months' time.

Query: What is Mary Hain's perspective on the California Public Utilities Commission's stance on refunds from power generators as of November 2000?
Expected Answer: The California Public Utilities Commission likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes.
Generated Answer: Mary Hain's perspective on the California Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) stance is reflected in her forwarding of an article that states the PUC is unlikely to order generators to refund billions in windfall profits from past wholesale power price spikes. She indicates that the commission is aware of market manipulation by generators but lacks the expertise to identify them and believes any legal action to force refunds would take many years and considerable resources, which the state may not be willing to commit. Furthermore, she notes that only two PUC members support refunds, and the commission is not inclined to allow utilities to pass their debts onto ratepayers.

Expected Answer: The California Public Utilities Commission likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and customers.
Generated Answer: The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) likely decided not to order power generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from the previous summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and customers. Although some commissioners acknowledged that generators were manipulating the wholesale power market, the CPUC lacked the necessary expertise to determine how this was occurring. Furthermore, forcing refunds would involve a lengthy court process that could take five to ten years, which the state was not willing to undertake. Therefore, it appears that the CPUC's decision favored not pursuing refunds from the generators at that time.

Expected Answer: Cara identified issues with the physical or not physical flag of path not showing up properly, path confirmation running times being too long, and the application freezing after the path confirmation task was finished.
Generated Answer: Cara identified several issues while testing the Preschedule workspace in her email from July 2001:

1. **Path Confirmation Issues**: The path confirmation process took over one hour for only 70 rows, which is deemed insufficient for production use. Moreover, many rows flagged for confirmation were not imported, and there was no error log available to help understand the reasons for this.

2. **Application Freezing**: After the path confirmation task, the application froze, and the status bar was no longer visible, preventing the application from being saved, closed, or examined further.

3. **Routing Functionality**: The physical or not physical flag of paths did not appear to be showing up properly in routing.

4. **Performance Concerns**: The running time for the path confirmation was excessively long, leading to concerns about its viability in a production environment.

5. **Error Logs**: Cara noted that she could not find a log to understand why certain deals were not imported into path confirmation.

Overall, these issues raised significant concerns about the functionality and reliability of the Preschedule workspace as it stood during testing.

Query: In January 2000, Paul Simons mentioned key points discussed in the meeting with Sullivan & Cromwell regarding reference credits. What are they?
Expected Answer: The key points include that non-energy reference credits are not a concern, about 200 energy reference credits are being considered, some will be definite 'ins' and others 'outs', and the product could initially launch with the 'ins'.
Generated Answer: In January 2000, Paul Simons discussed several key points in the meeting with Sullivan & Cromwell regarding reference credits. Here are the main points he mentioned:

1. There is generally no need to worry about non-energy reference credits, as they won't have any confidential information about them, and this category will likely become the majority over time.
2. There are about 200 energy reference credits being considered, and this class is unlikely to grow significantly.
3. Among the 200 energy credits, some will be definite "ins" (high-profile players without a special relationship) and some will be "outs" (where the relationship is too close to risk quoting).
4. The initial product launch could focus on the "ins," with plans to add the residual category later.
5. Evaluating relationships with individual reference entities may be tricky and time-consuming, and it is suggested to start with the business person responsible for the relationship to assess the nature of it and any sensitive information involved. 
6. There may be confidentiality agreements in place, but not much confidential information might be passing under them.

Expected Answer: From a regulatory perspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not authorised to deal here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated entity.
Generated Answer: Paul Simons mentioned several considerations for booking ENA's trades in London: 1. London-based traders should execute deals in the name of Enron Credit.com Ltd, not ENA. 2. Houston-based traders should handle transactions in the name of ENA. 3. Back-to-back transactions to transfer positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd can simplify financial and tax reporting. 4. Regulatory concerns prevent booking ENA's trades in London since ENA is not authorized to deal there and is not acting through Enron's regulated entity. 5. A service agreement is necessary for risk management from London, and the market risk will reside with ENA unless back-to-back trades are established with Enron Credit.com. 6. All hedged transactions should have matching terms regardless of the booking entity.

Expected Answer: The points included discouraging FERC from actions that would hurt the market, investigating market power, establishing price caps, and the IOUs failing to hedge against high prices.
Generated Answer: Richard Shapiro mentioned several points made during the FERC presentation on the California wholesale market in August 2000, which include the following:

1. There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market. They discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in California and the rest of the West.
2. High prices logically resulted from scarcity. If the Commission does anything, it should (1) investigate whether market power is being exercised by any party, and (2) if necessary to protect the market, establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.
3. The Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity; they have failed to hedge and underscheduled their load, leading to filling a large percentage of their load at ISO real-time prices. An analogy used was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme.
4. The market would function better if more information was provided to it.
5. The Commission should do whatever it can to incentivize participation by load.

Query: I received information from Tim Belden in October 2000 about the new price cap methodology that was passed by the ISO Board. What is it?
Expected Answer: The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 and will remain in place until comprehensive market changes have been implemented or ordered for removal by FERC or the ISO board.
Generated Answer: In October 2000, Tim Belden provided information about the new price cap methodology that was passed by the ISO Board on October 26, 2000. The key points of this methodology are as follows:

1. **Implementation**: The new price cap methodology was passed by a vote of 13-10 and is set to become effective on November 3, 2000, although achieving that start date may be challenging.
2. **Duration**: The methodology will remain in place until either comprehensive market changes are implemented, or it is ordered to be removed by FERC or the ISO board.
3. **Cap Prices**: Prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average, with specific caps set for different load levels, rounded to the nearest $5/MWh increment. For example:
   - <25 GW: $43.10
   - 25 GW to 30 GW: $56.70
   - 30 GW to 35 GW: $68.90
   - 35 GW to 40 GW: $108.90
   - >40 GW: $250/MWh
4. **Exemptions**: Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
5. **Posting**: The ISO will post price caps for each load level at least 48 hours before the beginning of each month and hourly caps at least 24 hours before delivery.
6. **FERC Context**: FERC has delegated cap authority to CAISO until November 15, 2000, and has to rule on an extension by November 18, 2000.

This information indicates that the price cap methodology aims to manage electricity prices in California effectively during a time of market instability.

Expected Answer: The consensus was not to use a UK company and to consider using a US corporation with a UK "arranger" to cover regulatory issues.
Generated Answer: In August 2000, discussions regarding the FX business and the use of a US corporation included the consensus to not use a UK company for contract purposes. This decision was influenced by the lack of a full ISD (chapter 10) firm and the desire to maintain MG's status. The advice from Sullivan & Cromwell suggested using a US corporation with a UK 'arranger' to address UK regulatory issues. Possible contractual entities mentioned were Enron North America, MG London Inc, or Newco Inc., with arrangers being EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd, or MG Brokers Ltd, depending on their chapter 3 status. The discussions were meant to finalize the approach based on the business's future location, which was to be discussed in a meeting on August 18th.

Query: In May 2001, Cynthia Franklin should include information about managing fluctuating wellheads. What should be included regarding managing fluctuating wellheads?
Expected Answer: You should include this and add that you were managing fluctuating wellheads while traders are taking short/long positions in the access area as well.
Generated Answer: The email from Mary Poorman outlines two scenarios for managing fluctuating wellheads: 

1. **Producing Wellheads**: If the wellheads are producing, the purchase from Calpine and any contracts hedged to it need to be backed up in the system at a wellhead level. This requires researching how those wellheads were allocated and paid, then reallocating them to the Calpine deal. 

2. **Non-Producing Wellheads**: If the wellheads are shut-in or permanently abandoned, the deal should be reallocated to zero and any hedges unwound or moved to another deal if possible. 

In both cases, it's important to clean up the deal back to the date of last flow at the meter.

Expected Answer: We are no longer requiring the $50MM NUI Corp gty for this transaction, and NUI must be the Guarantor not NUI Capital.
Generated Answer: In April 2001, Tanya Rohauer mentioned that since NUI Utilities, Inc. is the rated entity, they are no longer requiring the $50MM NUI Corp guarantee for the transaction. Additionally, a financial swap, which should be $40,000 per day for May to October, is being documented under the NUI Energy Brokers, Inc. existing ISDA. They also need to modify the financial confirmation to state that for this transaction only, NUI must be the Guarantor, not NUI Capital, and obtain a deal specific guarantee from NUI Utilities to cover this trade, likely around $10MM. This change was necessary because the financial/physical guarantee they were working on was no longer applicable since NUI Utilities is the rated entity with the associated balance sheet, making NUI Corp unnecessary.

Query: What should counterparties examine regarding their transactions with Enron as mentioned by Elizabeth Sager in November 2001?
Expected Answer: Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess this right.
Generated Answer: In November 2001, Elizabeth Sager emphasized that counterparties should examine their existing transactions with Enron in light of potential credit events, especially after a downgrade by Moody's Investor Service. She indicated that any downgrade could entitle counterparties to require Enron to provide additional credit in support of purchase obligations. It's also crucial for counterparties to review their documentation to avoid waiving rights that could foreclose access to performance and payment assurances. Furthermore, failure to declare a credit event could lead to defaults on the part of the counterparties themselves in related arrangements. This situation highlighted the importance of reassessing risk assessments and mitigation considerations based on Enron's financial condition.
